# Where do i begin?
I wanted to write a blog post eariler for once, not like at midnight. But can't seem to work out where to start off...

## Website update (and kinda a major one)
A lot of QOL changes have been made (for me mainly) but also some actualy improvements on the front end.

### Using git is so nice to track what happened.
Makes it way easier to see what changes i've done since the last blog post.

### Spelling
Whenever i do a blog, there is always something spelling related that appears. SO i'm just not going to talk about these much.
Just know that the blogs normally get spell checked (not grammer checked though) within some time of them being published.

Although, does anyone know a good grammer check action? Or a pre-commit hook for spelling and grammer checking? Due to working in `markdown` and `zed` there isn't really a spell checker, hence why i always have to get the actions to do so.

### Anyway, onto the main content... Projects Page!
The projects page is a page that is still a work-in-progress. Normally it wouldn't be on the main branch but due to certain circumstances i'm having to put it on the main branch anyway. It's in a decent stat but not in the state i would have hopped it would be in.
But first let me explain.

The project page is a list of all projects i've done in the past and a place for all future projects to go (upon project releasion). Currently it doesn't contain much information but i plan to eventually add images, and other things to kind of really sell said project.
That whole page is kinda my portfolio.

Of cause though, it doesn't actually contain **all** my projects. As you might notice from my github activity and repos, there are some not included. The ones on that page are ones which i wish to show off, wish to tell the world more about.
The projects not include are not include because i don't think of them as a good project. Although trying to think of an example is proving kinda hard...

Projects will also only really go on said page if they are in a state of completion, or released. For example, my game. Although it's a project it won't be added to the page until the game is released.

There is still a lot of stuff left to work on with the projects page, it was kinda hacked together after all. And well a hacked together page brings some issues...
The important issues will be sorted out soon and published before some of the less important stuff (design) is worked out.

### The big QOL feature for me, and welcome rust, sh.
The website now uses 2 new languages. Although not exactly.
The build process of the website has gotten two new languages, the render of the website and what you actually see is still limited to HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

But the build process now has a `rust` script and a `shell` script to help improve the builds.
I'll talk about the `shell` script in another part.

#### For now though, the rust script.
After the last couple of blog posts, i've been forgetting to update the json file which keeps track of all the information about said blog posts. Due to this, although the blog posts were technically accessible. They wouldn't show up on the list.
I got annoyed, and got the build process to do it for me.

But why rust?
In order to generate the json list, i need to get some information from the blog posts itself. I could have tried to do this with shell commands but rust is just way easier to understand which will help in maintence.
Due to the fact i've already been using rust for advent of code, it was easy enough (with some research on various aspects) to do stuff. I could have done it in python or something else, but i haven't touched python in a while and kinda want to do things in
rust for a while currently.

Besides, rust also complies down into a binary making it super easy to run due to not having to worry about installing anything, that is as long as i remember to move the binary file out of the `tools/target/` folder. Which i fear i might forget at one point.

As for the code itself, this block? (it's not a function, but it's also not a statement so what is it called?) is the main part:
```rust
// read the blog data. Is there a better way of doing this?
let blog_data = fs::read_to_string(p).unwrap_or(String::new());
let mut lines = blog_data.lines();
// first line is always preview line with the hash
let preview = lines.next().unwrap().to_string().replace("#", "");
// categories will be at the end, out of the way
let categories: Vec<String> = lines
    .last()
    .unwrap()
    .replace("Categories: [", "")
    .replace("]", "")
    .split_whitespace()
    .map(|c| c.to_string())
    .collect();
println!("Categories: {:?}", categories);

if categories.contains(&"hidden".to_string()) {
    // not meant to be include in the main list
    continue;
}

blogs.push(Blog {
    date,
    preview,
    categories,
})
```
The rest of the function is to do with getting the blogs, reading the data and saving the output. Not much of intrest *.(also defenitally not adding a code block here for a different reason later, no why would i do that?)*

Now that i've inserted this code, might as well explain a bit of it.
Short version: Read, iterator, get preview, get categories, check hidden, save.

There is no nede for a long version, the short version does it all.

One of the things i kinda like about rust, is the long statements. It's nice being able to do `.a().b().c().d().e().etc()` instead of assigning the result of each one to another variable all the time.
The amount of different functions you can call off a type is also nice, in my opinion, it's better to do that than parsing the result to a function all the time.

The rust functino is probably not the most memory efficient, but `clippy` doesn't complain and it works, so it works.
The debug is staying in for now, i have no reason the remove it. Yeah the function might take a little longer but thats not a big issue due to how the workflow runs.

As building the files (downloading, updating, compressing) takes the longest (especially for all the branches), this small job is done way beforehand hence it doesn't really matter that it takes a little longer.

#### And now, for the shell script
Although, this is likely to change after the recent changes. (exlained later)

Due to having the whole projects path build thingy on a seperate branch, the location links needed to be modified so that the branch would redirect (hopefully) to the right location.
As so, a simple script to just replace things in a file was needed.

But after the next feature, it's possible that the script is going to be useless.

### File compression, and branches update.
The goal of `/branches` was to allow you to go to any branch and view it like the main page, however i'm possible going to change the path.

To help with build times and file sizes, the workflow will only put files under said branch if they have been changed from the main branch.
The current system already has some issues. So even if by making this change i need to redesign something, it isn't actually all that bad.

The goal of the new system would be instead to go to something like `/<page>?branch=<Branch>&a=<b>`. The `?branch` option will just tell the `page_loader.js` to try and get all files from said branch, and if they don't exist use the main branch files instead.
I'll implement this system at a later date, but it does also mean the option of going to `/Branches` might be changed for a setting instead.

### Alright, enough of the backend QOL features. Time for the front end.
Thats right, even you get something to look forward to.

Two new features.

#### Reading from the start is way better than from the middle.
The blog page will now jump to the start of the blog whenever a blog is loaded. Due to the single page system, previously upon loading a blog the blog would stay whever you last were, or as close to as possible.

This new feature just makes opening them much smoother and makes more sense when opening a blog.

One of my plans with the blog is a cookie progression feature, so the keeping at where you last left off might be a thing in the future might not. But for now, each blog (including the advent of code log) will start you at the top.

#### I'm "Borrowing" some code here
```js
// Source: https://adventofcode.com/
// Triple click to select code blocks
window.addEventListener('click', function (e, s, r) {
  if (e.target.nodeName === 'CODE' && e.detail === 3) {
    s = window.getSelection();
    s.removeAllRanges();
    r = document.createRange();
    r.selectNodeContents(e.target);
    s.addRange(r);
  }
});
```
Advent of code has a really useful feature, where upon triple clicking a code block. The code block in it's entirity is selected.
It doesn't matter if it's multiline or part of a paragraph, the whole block is selected which makes it really useful for copying stuff like code.

So, like any good developer i'm borrowing the code (character for character pretty much). The above code was found in a script in the head of the aoc page, and consedering how small it is, it's really useful.
I could have tried to work out how to do it on my own, but some of these functions i've never seen before and am kinda happy that i can just copy them.

Do note, that feature does require javascript. But unless you're reading this post in pure `markdown` format, then well you must have javascript enabled.
Fell free to try it on any of the code elements (`inline` or blocks (above)), in this blog.

##### Why not just use a tiny copy button instead?
The tiny copy button works, it's just not really something that fits in very well with anything.
Most of the time, i end up selecting a portion of the code anyway and copying that instead of trying to find the copy button. Way quicker to just select anywhere rather than a small button.

It does mean, that this feature is however hidden until explained. But then, my whole website is like that in a way.

## Okay, thats enough website business for now.
And somehow yet again, i've ended up writting this at midnight.

Lets see... Oh, i know what to write next.

## I wanna complain at computers
Well, in particular. Windows and nivida.

NGL (not gonna lie), Windows and Nivida are good companies and when they work, they work brilliantly. But then you get people like me who just needs that extra bit which neither supports.
I know the stuff i'm about to talk about is something that well i should be used to dealing with (things not working), but it is still frustraighting even after using linux for 2 years.

I had to reset a drive for a family member recently, the drive got semi-corrupted (nothing got corrupted per say, but it wasn't fun to use) due to modifications of the partion table, which the only real solution was to completly wipe everything.
To make things easier, i did the wipe via windows, to also install windows at the same time (easier to let linux worry about partions than to leave it to windows).
It only took a couple hours and a usb-stick to get windows to decide to install... Something was so broken that the automatic repair couldn't well download and run itself.

Anyway, after that was sorted out. The next fun part came with graphics drivers.
Nivida works for the most part, until you put the computer to sleep in certain situations where the driver would just break stuff. Thankfully it's at the point where it isn't the worst. But it's not in perfect condition either.

SO fun, that took a decent amount of time away (it felt like it took longer due to how annoying everything was)

## However, computers are fun.
Whilst writting the previous section, i had to pause to think as for how long i've been using linux.
And with my current setup, everything just works smoothly. Yes some things are a pain to get around but most daily activites are fine. It's at the point where i don't have to complain at the operating system all the time.

My current setup is my laptop and my phone. Which work well together. Using [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/), my phone is basically just a communicating device whilst my laptop actually does all the work.
All my notifcations sent to my phone are also sent to my laptop (as a notification), whilst my phone can also provide a hotspot connection and a VPN to connect home if i need one.

My linux version is well... easily explained in this picture
![My linux information provided by fastfetch](Blog/Assets/2025-01-11/Screenshot_20250111_012710.png)

KDE has made customisation very easy, whilst some of the default applications provided has improved aspects over windows (the file explorer here is way better than on windows).

Even though i'm a linux main. I still keep windows around for those rare cases where i actually do need windows for something. As in an app that linux doesn't want to run (even via compatability layers).

## Advent of code 2015 is intresting..
The first year, where the whole story aspect is random and nothing is standerised. Kinda made it felt like it was designed as a test project and not something that was going to keep going for 10 years.

However it has also been an easy year. I've already completed 17 days (skipped day 13), in probably a shorter time than any other year so far.
The lack of any standards is annoying though, but it is also what gives that year its unique charm. Everything has to start somewhere right?

## Enough computer related stuff, why do we not have more forms of transport?
And what i mean by that is stuff like blimps + airships. (wait, ain't they just the same thing)

Apparently it turns out that we do, just not as common. And even then, the design isn't like any medieval based ones. They look so small for how big they are.
Point being, it would be kind of nice for more forms of air travel that are widely alvalible other than just planes, even if said travel takes longer.

Steampunk seemed to have it all, and yet we seemed to have none of it even though we should have better technology. Maybe steampunk maths is a bit too unrealistic.

## Somehow i've ended up finishing this on saturday.
The website section took up a normal post, so i wanted to add more but couldn't think of much more, hence why it took an extra day.

Oh well, thankfully just need to change the file name, and let the action do the rest.

## Fine, i'll end it here.
I can't think of anything else to put so, yeah. Sometimes these seem so small whilst also so long.

Oh well, i'll have more stuff to talk about next week hopefully.
