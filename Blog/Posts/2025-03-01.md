# Welcome to March! Time for another monthly update.

March already?

## A new format
Although blogs have been coming out every weekend (weekend fells more of a better word here), i want to do something slightly new.

On the first day of each month, weekend or not, a monthly update blog / section of blog. So, why not just start today?

## The review
Time to look back on the goals set for february. And well, they are still a lot not completed.

The main goals for february were website related which are both still in progress. I won't talk much about the LDG one as that is unreleased content, but i'll talk about my website at least.

### SO what got achieved?
As the list was so long, i moved it into [a readme](https://dragmine149.github.io/ReadMe.md) (or in a better format on [github](https://dragmine149.github.io/github/website/)). This new list location is a win-win, both parties can keep updated on what is happening.

I've already talked about a lot of the changes in this post: [2025-02-15](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2025-02-15) but to shrink and catch up:
- rewrote page loader
- modules (markdown not tied to blogs anymore)
- Improved blogs with features like localtime, image scrolling, spelling.

And as for the new features since...

#### Branch System
The rewrite of `new_loader.js` has made the system supposily 10x better than previously, however it was still not perfect especially with the actions not actually working. (They weren't breaking they just weren't doing what i wanted them to).
Eventually with the help of AI and some online research, this "shell" script was made (yes it's shell but it's technically not a script so...):
```yaml
# some unimportant other parts of file

- name: Get files
  run: |
    mkdir -p temp/Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}
    git clone --branch ${{ matrix.branch }} https://github.com/dragmine149/dragmine149.github.io.git temp/Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}

- name: get changed files
  id: changed
  run: |
    cd temp/Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}
    git diff --name-only ${{ matrix.branch }}..origin/main > ../../../changed_files.txt

# compress said files
- name: Compress
  run: |
    mkdir -p Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}
    for file in $(cat changed_files.txt); do
      echo "$file"
      if [ -e temp/Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}/$file ]
      then
        echo "File exists"
        basedir=$(dirname $file)
        mkdir -p Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}/$basedir
        mv temp/Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}/$file Branches/${{ matrix.branch }}/$basedir;
      fi
    done

# upload here
```
The above code was taken from [website.yaml](https://github.com/dragmine149/dragmine149.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/website.yml).

The hardest part, was getting the files that had changed between the different branches. Actions are slightly confusing because each individual "job" uses a different instance, different file system. However all tasks in a job use the same one.
For a long while, i tried to get a task to output something to github just so another task in the same job could use it right afterwards... (This was a pain and thankfully i don't have to do that.)

To break it up quickly:
- "Get Files" task is a custom checkout as `actions/checkout@v4` acts similarly to running `$ git checkout --single-branch ${BRANCH} ${REPO}` but we needed more data.
- "get changed files" task uses `git diff` to get the names of the files between the previously checkouted branch and the **remote** main branch (we could use local, but we don't have local). And stores it in a file in the root directory.
- "compress" task, uses the previous file. Checks if exists and movies it over to a different directory.

So now the `/Branch` part of the website, actually has data in! However... it's broken still. Although (when published from a working workflow branch), you can access the page... everything is broken.
![Broken page image](Blog/Assets/2025-03-01/broken_settings.png)

This is going to require a deeper dive at some point but has less of a pirority than some other features on the site. such as...

#### Seasonal backgrounds
Welcome to spring, and as you may (actually, you would have to have seen them already don't lie). We have cherry blossoms as the background now! From the same system as the snow in winter, just with different settings.
Winter has long since gone, and it's quite rare for snow in march. Hence the perfect time to change the background.

As well as a new background, we have a new system [DayJS](https://day.js.org/). A better `Date` module. The purpose of this new system is to allow the background to change more automatically. Although i do still need to make summer and autumn themed particle systems.

Talking about the particle system, is there a better one than [particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)? `particle.js` is a good one, and it works perfectly. However the API is a bit lacking and it hasn't really been updated in 10 years...
I'm still going to use it for now, it works so it's less important than finding a new one. I just would like something with a slightly more friendly API and maybe a bit less cpu intensive... (according to firefox, the cpu can be between 8% and 20%).

The better api is because of this work around i did on the Settings branch:
```js
if (pJSDom.length > 0) {
  pJSDom[0].pJS.fn.vendors.destroypJS();
  pJSDom = [];
}
```
The above code allows the particles to be destroyed to stop the system and actually disable them. However i would have preferred to do something like `particlesJS.stop()` instead as `particlesJS.load()` already exists.

#### The last small update, beer css.
For those unaware [beer css](https://www.beercss.com/) is what i use to help out a lot of the css side of the website. This like the hidden snackbars, the buttons, etc has mostly already been done by beercss.
Of cause, beercss isn't enough on it's own, in places i do still need to do my own css to get things to work, but using this helps save a lot of time.

The confusing thing is, their updates. Before, my original goal was to update beercss to `v3.9.0` however that quickly changed to `v3.9.3` and then `v3.9.4`. Everytime they made a small fix they didn't document it but instead just moved the [release](https://github.com/beercss/beercss/releases/) up a version.
Although soon, we're going to be using `v3.9.6` (it contains a useful required feature).

#### And now for the big, semi-yet-to-be-released update.
Meet the Settings page.

With the wonderful technology of [localStorage and Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) we can now store user settings in the browser. I would have released this a couple of weeks ago, but i was debating on the cookie banner.

Eventually i decided to just not use a cookie banner for the reason of: "Nothing gets sent to the server, everything is stored locally". Hence no need to tell people about cookies. If on a future date i get complaints about not having one, then i'll add it.
But personally, a cookie banner / popup is a useless and annoying feature that just makes sites look bad / not work. I get why sites need to show it (the law), but sometimes too many sites show one when they really don't need to.
I also know, i can just get rid of it by clicking a button. But that ruins the first-time experience, especially when parts of the page are blocked until cookies are dealt with.

The settings page is mostly completed, at the time of writing i've made a pull request for me to deal with tomorrow. But like everything, i've designed it so that it's really easy to just expand and add new settings when i want.
This is done in two ways. The file `settings.json` which is a big json storage of setting. and using `Settings.add_listener()`.  For the sake of not making stuff confusing, i'll explain it in greater detail once i've merged the two branches.

#### Almost forgot, day night cycle has a new system.
Although this is still under development.

### Achieved done. Anything else worth of note?
Not really.

Other than the 7... anime i completed (wow that was smaller than expected), and the amount of games played.

The life i want to share is kinda booring sometimes, although maybe march is going to change that?

## SO to the future! TO MARCH.
I've been waiting for march for a while now. As i explained back in an earlier post during febrauary, i want to get back into content creation. There is also other things i intend to do during march, so lets start listing them.

### More website updates.
The website is always under going improvements, working from scratch with all these features is going to take a while to fully complete. So this is my planned list of things to complete (without going overboard):
- Settings (should be this weekend)
- Improved day/night system (soon hopefully)
- Figure out a way to "fetch" images from `raw.githubusercontent.com` instead of bundling them with the website.
- Blog improvements such as:
  - Back button (other than browser back)
  - Ability to link to certain parts in the blog
  - Ability to jump between blog headings
  - Improved CSS (links and lists don't really look all that well)
  - In-site links (links that show a page on this site will go to that page instead of reloading the site to go to that page).

Hopefully this small list isn't too much overboard. All of these should be fairly simple but all QOL features. The main one being improved blog css (i won't argue, it looks terrible). Some other fatures like `fetch images` and `in-site links` are just there to
improve the experience of using the site (and future profing), which are less important but still useful and has some importance over the rest.

### Chapter 1 of a story
Yes a story, and chapter 1 of it. I intend to release chapter 1 on my site tomorrow (<t:1740873600:D>), i just need to clean some stuff up first.

This story is by no far way near completion, and turned out to be less like a story and more like a script (I'll explain in the next section). I'm not intending for this to get any massive traction, or for people to love it. I just want to release something that i did.

Writing is kinda a semi hobbie of mine, i do enjoy just writing stuff down on a page when i can think of stuff. Hence why i made it. I wanted to fully complete it during february, but that was a bit too big of a task (i think i still have 5 or so chapters left...
depending on how fast i pace it). In the past, i've tried to write dialogue for a game (which i might go and dig up at some point), i also quite enjoyed the creative writing sections during english lessons and tests.

Once again, i'm not aiming for perfection. I just want to write something and release it.

Annoyingly i have kinda ran into writers-block. So although i've started chapter 2, it's going to be a while before that chapter comes out. Defenitally not happening in March for sure though.

### More work on my game
Which i won't talk much about, although i do plan to release it this year... hopefully (i've been working on it since <t:1699488000:D> so).
It's still going to take a while to complete, got a whole bunch of bugs to iron out before i can work on adding any more features (don't really want to build on bugs).

### New visual novel completion?
I recently started [Mashiroiro Symphony HD -Love is Pure White-](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737970/Mashiroiro_Symphony_HD_Love_is_Pure_White/), which at the moment idk how long it'll take me. But i do plan to slowly work my way through all 6 routes.
If i do complete it, i will talk about it. If i don't, then i won't talk about it until i do.

### Ok, enough procasinating. Time to talk about streaming.
I mentioned this back at the start of february when i added `marked_local_time.js`. I was doing youtube related stuff and then got depressed? (question mark is for i actually don't really know), either way i took a break. I did try a couple of times but could never
get past the recording line. But now with the help of [Shitsuren shita node VTuber Hajimetara Toshiue no Oneesan ni Motemashita (I Was Heartbroken, So I Became A VTuber, But Then I Became Popular with the Older Ladies)](https://myanimelist.net/manga/171507) i want
to do more stuff again. So...

give me a moment... *editing `marked_local_time.js`*
alright done.

Every <t:1741046400:w>, <t:1741219200:w>, <t:1741392000:w> at <t:1741392000:t>. I **aim** to be live for 2 hours until <t:1741399200:t>. (This took me a while to workout because for me, it's still the previous day until i go to sleep)

The reason for the "aim" is due to whats happening IRL. I can't guarantee that i can stream every day i want to. Mainly because i want to stream after everyone else in the house has gone to bed so i'm undisturbed. However sometimes that doesn't happen until late.
I've chose those 3 days as then i'm the most free. Tuesday and Thursday nights are spent doing ironing, whilst The weekend is spent for playing with friends. It does mean however, i'll be streaming 2 hours after my [oshi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/10gjt3s/explain_to_me_what_an_oshi_is/)
(yes i have someone i conseder to be my oshi, not saying who though.) which means i'll have less time to watch anime, but then i can always rearrange the anime schedule (and tbh, 30-odd anime is quite a lot...).

So, what am i going to stream?

One of the puporse of writing a story to begin with, was to turn it into manga, well kind of.
According to a [form post on MAL](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=141104)
```
To help give an overview of what is eligible to be added to MyAnimeList's manga database, we've compiled a brief list of points for members who are reading the guidelines for the first or second time. Please use the expanded rules in the main guidelines for details on how to complete your submission.

- Manga are comics created in Japan for the Japanese market
  - Manhwa (Korea) and manhua (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan) are also allowed.

- All manga from established print publishers are OK
  - An established print publisher is a reputable company whose main business is to physically print bound volumes of manga and distribute them to booksellers in the country of origin.
  - Printed manga and one-shots included in manga magazines are all eligible for the database.
  - Extras included with other material are eligible under some conditions (see 1.2.5)
  - Digital-only manga from established print publishers are also accepted (see 1.2.7 & 1.2.9)

- Webcomics/webtoons from established digital publishers must have their platform whitelisted to be eligible
  - Whitelisted platforms are deemed to distribute content which meets professional standards after internal review.
  - Our current whitelist can be found in section 1.2.8 and will be expanded with time.

- Light Novels, Novels & Doujinshi are included in our Manga DB under some conditions
  - See Sections 1.2.3, 1.2.4 & 1.2.6 for details.
```
Hence what i'm doing won't be considered "Manga" as i'm from the UK hence the whole first point is completely out of the question. Idk what it's consedered if not manga, however for now i'll keep calling it manga.

So, whats the actually plan?

The plan (although potentially annoying and semi-stupid) is to draw out my story i've spent the past month working on like any other mange would be drawn out, with my semi terrible drawing skills (it's not going to be a work of art.) And to add insult to injury
stream it all at the same time.

Depending on situations, there might be days when i stream something else. But for now the plan is to draw. Video creation might come back at a later date, depending on if i have something to record that doesn't crash my laptop.

I'm not expecting much from the streams, and i shouldn't be. If i expect too much i'm just going to end up not wanting to do anything again. I just want to have fun, talk and stream.

Lastly, the conditions for a stream are as follows:
- The days and times mentioned above
- I'm not too tired / the next day doesn't require me to do something big
- House is quiet (which might delay stream start time)
- Stream is at least 1h long (i won't be starting a stream at like <t:1740791700:t> because then it'll be a bit too short for my liking).

Due to these conditions, i can't really promise anything. I might announce when i'm live on social media (yet to be decided), and i might have the website advertise my stream via a banner or smth. But that's yet to be decided and something i'll decided on the day.

## Alright time to wrap up.
The future and past have been talked about. Now time to watch some anime before a lot of "setup" work has to be done tomorrow.

The next time we meet, will probably be during a stream or the next blog. Or well whenever, just enjoy March ok. *pout*
