# Already May?
Apparently so... Which means another monthly update.

## Although, the second of may.
I started writing on the first, yet got side tracked so now i'm finishing this on the second.

## Like always, April recap.
Apparently past me didn't make things easy for today me.

I went to go grab the list of things from [April's Day 1 blog post](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2025-04-01). Yet there wasn't anything to copy so time to make the list...

## The April list
- ETOH
- Youtube Interface Downloader
- Improve Blog/Pages
- Slow work on game

And yet i've haven't touched half of them.
### Eternal Tower of Hell Tower/Badge Tracker
This is the only project with the most work completed on it, one which i hoped to get done before today but another project got in the way of that.

So far, the server-side roblox badge fetching part is done. The UI is semi done and the backend is a mess.
#### Server side badge fetching.
There is a reason this is `Server-side`. Because of something called [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS/Errors/CORSMissingAllowOrigin). CORS can be hard to explain, so to put it in other words. Most websites don't allow you to
access content on their page from another website.

Roblox has CORS Enabled, which means that we can't get the javascript side to send a request directly to roblox. And if we can't send a request to the badge API to get the badge data, we can't really do anything. However, we have a secret (not secret) weapon...

Cloudflare! Using CLoudflare workers as a proxy allows us to get all the data we want from roblox. Hence a week or two later, the proxy is finished (or at least at `v0.3.2`). The proxy can be visited here: https://roblox-proxy.dragmine149.workers.dev/ Well
the documentation can at least. The code for the proxy is actually here: https://github.com/dragmine149/roblox-proxy. For now the proxy is open to anyone to use. However if cloudflare gets annoyed at me, i might have to block some sites from access it.

Using this proxy also comes with another benefit. We can standerised all the return types (because the data roblox returns is all over the place) and do some more server side processing allowing for custom API end points that roblox doesn't normal offer.
It did however, take a long while to setup the proxy, get everything work and all the end points. Hence whats taken up most of the time. However now that it's done, it means i don't have to touch it again until something breaks.

#### Client side UI.
*thinking...* Yeah, lets show this. (Even though its not much of a secret) The source code is already public, hence you go just go download it and host a local server to see it in action. But for those who don't, here it is. The towers page.
![Towers Page](Blog/Assets/2025-05-02/Screenshot_20250426_133427.png)

Why the towers page? Well that is where the action is. The main page has no action and the other pages are not as important. However there is one big noticibe issue in that screenshot. Its a totally different felling to the main site, aka this site.

This different layout is done on purpose. The layout is based off https://jtoh.info/ with some addition changes. As for the difference according to my main site. My site is my site, however this subpage is something which i want to be visited by people who dont
want something other the top with a lot of complexities. Hence something easy. Making it look similar just makes using it as easy as using the other site.

#### Back-end being a mess.
And by back-end i mean the javascript running on the users device. This is a mess partially because its trying to be like 10 different things at once. I'm in the progress of rewriting it and once rewritten then the website should be mostly done and ready to be
opened to the public.

Originally the backend was just for EToH but like the proxy, half of the code could be used for other roblox related projects so slowly got migrated and causing a big mess. I did intend to stick with the mess and rewrite it after release, but because of the
system to store badge information need to be changed slightly. The whole backend kinda needs a rework to accompain that change.

### Youtube interface download
This is a project on the back burner for now.

I've started to work on this project, and then got side tracked with many other projects. As for the progress, well we get the title from a provided video and thats all. Until i have less projects, this one is going to wait a while before being continued.

### Website Improvements / Game progress
Like the youtube interface downloader, these have also been put on hold. Hence i don't have much to talk about them.

I do want to continue them during may though. SO yeah.

## Why did everything get put on hold?
Because of a different project. `CC:Tweaked`. I already talked about this in detail [last week](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2025-04-26). But because it's new territory, it's taken longer than i would have liked. I've already spent like two days working
on something just to undo it all because theres a better/another way of doing it.

The boombox project is nearly done though. It's at the point of being able to play sound. I just need to add a settings menu, tidy things up, fix bugs, finish downloads menu. A "small list"

## So for my goals in May
- Finish off CC:Tweaked Boombox (and release it on github)
- Release EToH TT (not finish, just releasing it. If i attempt to finish it before release it's going to take a lot longer).
- Work on game some more
- Maybe work a bit on website.

The Boombox is nearly done and shouldn't take that long (last words hehe..). EToH TT i want to get out before [Purgatorio](https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Purgatorio) which gives me just under 2 months minimum. It's a semi long time, but quicker i get it out, the less
i have to worry about it.

My game and website work are basically just going to end up being whenever i get time to do so. Theres also another sub-project i want to do which is to update a wiki some more (which is not important here).

My game is in a state of just fixing and finding bugs, whilst the website is in a state of just needing to sit down and think about things.

## Although, i do want to release a new mini-ish game.
A new feature on my website, which uses javascript because trying to do it in CSS would take forever. But it's an upgrade tree.

Upgrade tree games are one of my faviourte types of games, especially on roblox. The best upgrade tree game i've come across so far is https://www.roblox.com/games/122809141833750/Everything-Upgrade-Tree. And although i don't want to make something as empressive
as EUT, i do want to make an upgrade tree game.

I have no idea on the direction i want to go with it yet, All i know is that it's something i want to do. So thats going to be for a future project.

## Now... Erm, idk.
I haven't really had anything of much interest to talk about recently. So for a while, i might end up skipping a week if there is nothing to talk about.

I'll still do posts for project releases / updates. I just don't want these to fell booring because its just repeating the same stuff over and over again.

So for now, time to publish this and get to working on smth
