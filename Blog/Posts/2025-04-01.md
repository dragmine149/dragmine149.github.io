# Welcome to april.
Another monthly update, like always.

## First off, get the fool out of the room.
Oh

there is no fool.. I haven't had time (or any ideas) to make an april fools day joke this year. So yeah. I might make a one next year though, who knows?

As for the april fools jokes i've seen so far this year... NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD
- [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/) has a little "chat" bot. Which broke for me (probably my javascript blocker), but basically whatever you asked it, it responded with... One Piece, except for one branch which gave a reference to medalist.

I've linked the js file [here](Blog/Assets/2025-04-01/mal.js) as an archive for future reference.
- [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) had probably one of the more funnier ones, they changed some recent popular anime covers to hand drawn arts "immitadting" the anime original. Some are really well done, like `Ao no Haku`, however some are really funny
like `Shangri-La Frontier`.

- [ScrapMan](https://www.youtube.com/@scrapman) did a good one with realistic rock climbing "game". Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmgxJZeMCSc

Those are the ones i've found decent at least. There are also some which are just repeating previous years but slightly different.

## Anyway enough of that, where have i been?
I haven't posted in just over 2 weeks (at time of writing, true time is <t:1742083200:R>). Well i've been busy. Last week i got assigned something to be completed by today (which i did and is released), and the week before was just a mixture of playing and
other stuff. But sometimes it is nice to just have a break off doing something for a while.

## So, time for march recap.
Lets start with the goals, as a recap:
- More website updates
- story cpt1
- game progress
- visual novel progress
- streaming

### Website updates
The list of things to change was as followed.

- Settings (should be this weekend)
- Improved day/night system (soon hopefully)
- Figure out a way to "fetch" images from `raw.githubusercontent.com` instead of bundling them with the website.
- Blog improvements

And most got improved, other than the blog (Sorry, it's going to be a while longer before an update here).

So for my march goals. I want to:
- Improve blog (for real this time)
- Improve pages such as story / projects

### Story chapter 1
Which got released, you can actually go and read the "script" right now. At some point i want to tidy up the first chapter, and make it less like a script and more like a light novel (i think).

As for chapter 2, that is already in the works. Unlike when i released chapter 1, i actually have an idea for the plot. So at some point i'll continue to write and complete that. Based off my current plot / ideas, i'm guessing the story is going to end
up having 7 - 10 chapters. The length of each chapter will be really variable though.

### Game progress
*checks gitea on pi*
Some progress was made indeed, Managed to fix a bunch of bugs i self-reported. Also managed to fix a big performance issue. Although it's not as much progress as i would have wanted, it's certainly a lot.
My goal for april is to slowly work on it, at least fix the remaining bugs.

### Visual novel progress
Basically none. I played some but not a lot. With the 30+ anime i had, and the amount of time spent playing. I ended up spending most of my time watching anime (and catching up) instead of playing the VN.

However, with my list being shorter for Spring25, i should have more time to play. Still have no Estimated time of completing the first route though.

### Streaming
I tried, i promise. I've already spoken about this in a [previous blog](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2025-03-16) as a tldr; my computer isn't powerful enough to do that stuff. So for now this is on hold.


## Recap over, the goals of april...
Have already been outlined, mostly. I do want to add on the two projects i'm working on currently though.

Those are: [ETOH](https://github.com/dragmine149/ETOH), and a interface to download YT videos. I'll explain more of these upon releasing them. Both projects aren't that big to the point where they will take up the whole month.
ETOH has been fun, due to the fact i've need to learn [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).

## Anything else to add?
Yes, quick update on anime.

During Winter25, i ended up watching like 30 at once. (of cause, spread over the 7 days in the week). Which is not bad, but it's a lot. Hence why i'm thankfully watching less in Spring25.

I've been enjoying using the pi as a server. Really glad i set that up. I don't think i've explained this much, but basically the pi is a local git / whatever server. Really useful.

## Alright, time to wrap up.
Normally i would write another 20 lines or so, however i can't really think of much else to add in this overview post.

Part of me just wants to get on with ironing as well (get to finish watching a season of anime today because i have the time to do so). So until next time (which shouldn't be in 2 weeks). erm... something.
