# December mini update
As it's been 3 months now (almost)

## Where have i been?
I've been around, streaming sometimes and slowly working on code. Without anything to push me forward, code progress is super slow and personal estimations go out of the roof.

So, why this now? Because AOC is back.

## Whats happening?
If none of this makes sense, its on purpose. I'm even going to force the pi to bypass this blog notification just as it's not ready. Anyway...

December is here, which means AOC is back, which means i'm going to update that blog like i do every year. Thought i might as well put out a small notice whilst i was there updating day 1.

As for the website, as per the notice, i've been giving it a touch up and it already looks better, functions better and html code is nicer to work with thanks to tailwind. That being said, the update is nowhere near ready and will take more time before
i can release it. Normally, i wouldn't care how many parts of it i release, but this one i do as some things just break which i don't want to disable yet.

As for EToH BT (badge tracker), thats also getting a massive refresh. The refresh is nearly done, there are a few parts left behind but having to work on the data scraping from the wiki is slowing progress down (and me just slowing it down in general).
That subsite is probably going to be released before the main site, but i'll try and align them both..

And thats it for side projects, and this update.
