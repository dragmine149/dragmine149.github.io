# Advent of code log 2025
Same as last years, expect tile generator is broken for now.

## Day 1
Today is a safe lock, one which is semi common just turning back and forth. Hence, conversion was super easy.
```rs
#[aoc_generator(day1)]
fn parse(input: &str) -> Vec<i64> {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
        	// splits into ['L'/'R', String(number)]
            let info = line.trim().split_at(1);

            let dir = match info.0 {
                "L" => -1,
                "R" => 1,
                _ => panic!("Invalid direction ({:?})", info.0),
            } as i64;

            info.1.parse::<i64>().unwrap() * dir
        })
        .collect::<Vec<i64>>()
}
```
Just convert them into numbers to work with later. Simple. It did take me a while to get the `split_at` method i wanted, but it works quite nice. And ofc, panics if issues because if we can't parse, we can't do day.

### Part 1
The easiest part.

Just mod the input by 100, add/sub that check for 0 and continue. 


### Part 2
Which took me just under 2 hours to complete... All you had to do is implement div and count how many times you div.

Looking back at my first commit checkpoint, i wasn't that far off. Just missing some `else` (due to my tendency to avoid them) and a tad bit of incorrect logic.  And yet, i spent over an hour trying to use loops and structs instead. There was like 15
minutes or so of waiting involved just for AOC to let me submit an answer *had to wait 10 minutes at most for the last submit* 

In the end, kinda looked at a friends repo to see what i was doing wrong. So cheated in a way but as simple as it is, i don't think i could have gotten many "hints" (maybe more input examples but eh)

Hopefully tomorrow doesn't cause as much trouble.
