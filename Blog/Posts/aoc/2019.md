# AOC 2019 -> Done in Binary (yes, binary)

Well, not writing out pure `10100110101001`, it's more of logic gate simulator. Thanks to [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.game/)

## Day 1
Spent most of the time working on this puzzle just trying to create a file -> binary loader. Got to work out how to turn the string representation of `1969` into `0000 0111 1011 0001`.
Which is [`49`, `57`, `54`, `57`] (`0011 0001`, `0011 1001`, `0011 0110`, `0011 1001`). Ontop of that, had to split the newlines (10) for each cell.

Finally made this system though:
![A screenshot of a bunch of wires and modules, with each wire containing a number showing its value](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d1/Screenshot_20250713_173921.png)

The orange lines to the left link up to a RAM module (to store the information)
The yellow line up explains how many pieces of information there are
The gray line up tells the system that it can go.

The internals of the structure are complex, and there is defenitally room for improvement. But i have unlimited gates and delay so i'll probably end up improving it slowly overtime as days need it. But to explain what happens:

- The file gets read at position `FFFF FFFF  FFFF FFFF  FFFF FFFF  FFFF FFFF  FFFF FFFF  FFFF FFFF  FFFF FFFF  FFFF FFFF` (internal number for length of file)
- That is then stored in a registor (middle of picture). The file length is important, so that we don't end up wasting thousands or millions of loops just to get to the end of the file.
- The file is read at position `0`, for `8` bytes (forced 8, nothing much to do about that).
- The 8 bytes get converted into numbers. Example: `12\n14\n19` (`4,121,086,353,298,043,441` or `0011 1001  0011 0001  0000 1010  0011 0100  0011 0001  0000 1010  0011 0010  0011 0001`) to `49 50 10 49 52 10 49 57`
- Which then checks for the first new line (`10`), returns that position (in this case 3)
- The numbers before that are added with the formula `p * 10 + n`, where n is the new number and p is the previous number (or potential carry from previous 8 bits).
- The index is added to the 64b register on the left, which then moves the pointer in the file. Whilst the result is saved in memory.
- At the same time, a counter is incremented. This later tells the computer how many pieces of memory we have.

As said though, it's unoptimised. Obviously i'm not going to optimise it to the point where it's the most optimual program ever. But some things like the registers could be replaced for delay lines to improve it slightly.


The main system however, is much simpler. It's literally just this:
![The main system, containing the RAM on the left, an component, adder and register](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d1/Screenshot_20250713_175844.png)
*This is technically p2 image, but p1 is pretty much the same*

Ok, ok. This is the true form of the component:
![The true form of the program, containing a (red) input and output, three constant data cells, divider, adder, negativer, comparison nodes](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d1/Screenshot_20250713_180055.png)

The maths for the day is `Divide by 3, round, minus 2`, hence that what we do.
- Divide by 3, yet only keep the top (div) output as the bottom (mod) gets lost due to rounding anyway.
- Add the negative value of 2. (There is no `subtract` in binary, you just add and cause an overflow to occur in order to subtract)
- Lastly, we output the number. After checking to see if it's greater than `-2` (unsigned version). This means we aren't adding -2 to our result later, potentially offsetting it.

And here is the part 2 version
![Part 2 version, which also includes a bunch of other components](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d1/Screenshot_20250713_180335.png)

The part 1 version is included, obviously. It's just a single square near the left (with -2 on it)

But with the help of delay logic, we can just keep looping through applying the same operation until we get to 0. (As negative fuel is no fuel). The first delay gate (left), keeps track of the current number (as it's being divided, etc). The second
one on the right keeps track of the sum.
The yellow line out top. Tells the computer to "pause" whilst the maths for this cell is compiling. Otherwise we'll just skip a bunch of numbers. The yellow line also tells the right delay gate to reset itself, as it prevents the loop from happening.
Without it auto resetting like this, the previous cells maths would just carry on to the next screwing the maths by a lot in some cases.

There are multiple switches, partially just to avoid conflicts of signals as things have to loop back onthemselfs a lot. Once done, the main computer just handles it and procedues.

Finally, the last circuit.
![The halt circuit, consisting of one registers, one counter and some switches.](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d1/Screenshot_20250713_184248.png)

This circuit takes the counter value as soon as the file has reached its end. This is stored so that we know when we've reached the end of the memory. Hence avoiding more waste ticks again.
The counter is another counter, just for memory position. However the value is also checked against the value stored in the register. If they are equal, the program auto halts as the end has been reached.

The rest of the logic, is just to prevent the system from getting activated too early.


And finally, i made a no memory (RAM) solution. Just for fun really. And it's slightly better (makes sense, not having to waste time storing data)
![No RAM Solution, based on P2 Solution](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d1/Screenshot_20250713_190432.png)

I could get rid of a lot of circuits, the things to load the memory. The things to check end of memory. Most of the core circuitry around the file loader is still there.
The toughest bit to work out, was probably the triple and gate logic. Making sure it wasn't activated too early or too late. I couldn't leave it to the one line, otherwise the last bit of info in the file wouldn't have finished being processed before
i halted.

Overally, the no mem solution takes `978` ticks whilst the memory solution takes `1.1k` ticks (exactly value is unknown after `1k`)


## Day 2
And to start off with, i "remade" the file loading system...
![The new loading system, with less wires](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d2/Screenshot_20250716_002853.png)

The main goal of this system, was to process as much data as possible at once. For example, the input `12\n14\n19` translates to `4,121,086,353,298,043,441`. So instead of processing it like 3/3/x, the idea was to process it like 8/x. Hence, we can
reduce file loading as we only need to go every 8 bytes instead of every 3 bytes. The problem? The data needs to be stored in memory for manipulation later. And although we can save 4 things in 1 cell, i didn't really want to try and deal with extra
maths for just loading data. The other option would be to add to a queue, and slowly add to memory, but thats no different and the queue would need to be gigantic.

However, not all was in vain. Part of the new system i just reused in the old system instead due to them being much nicer to work with. Hence came this design
![A new file loader design, with pointer position on left, files down bottom, number convetor to the right](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d2/Screenshot_20250716_003612.png)

![The internals of the number convetor, consists of multiple lines processing and combining numbers](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d2/Screenshot_20250716_003751.png)

This new system is way easier to manage, as there is way less random components and everything is neetly organised. The only annoying thing, we haven't gotten rid of some of the massive headload, which is the `x10+n` nodes. In order to compress the
numbers, we have to pass the output from the last node into the next. and with each node being `2015/142`, that quickly adds up. The other option would be to change how much of the 8 bytes we process to something like 1. But that would just be a
waste of ticks. Part of the problem comes with the gigantic size of the 64b components `1376/50`, `512/88`, `119/4`, for the multiplier, adder, and mux representively. I do want to find a better solution for `x10` as we could probably save a couple
of gates there, it's just x10 isn't a fun number to work with in binary...

The other benefit of this system, is the file stack. All we have to do is delete a wire and place a wire to change which file we want to access. I would have wanted just to do clickable switches, but TC doesn't have them.

### Part 1
Technically, i've already done this part. I started to make a fully fledge Intcode computer in TC like half a year ago, before getting stuck and well "putting it on hold". It's also the reason for this whole project in TC instead of something like
rust. But i decided to redo it anyway.
![The solution to part 1, my basic Intcode Computer](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d2/Screenshot_20250716_005650.png)

On the left is a mess of wires, these communicate with what to load/save at any given time. Theres a lot of switches and checks to prevent wire collisions. Most of the computer is controlled via a 64b counter, set to increment of 1. Even though we
can increment by 4 per completed cycle, some opcodes only need increments of 1/2/3, hence 1 is easier (and besides, we do 4 just from reading).

The right contains the 4 custom 64b register storage. My original (intcode computer) version just used 64 bit registers, but here, i'm using delay logic and switches as my register.
![The "register", containing 2 and gates, 3/2 in/out. 2 delay and switches for storage](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d2/Screenshot_20250716_010138.png)

This version comes in at `199/6`, better than a register at `264/4`. The reason i made this version, was because i wanted to use the delay trick as a way to save data. But needed slightly more data storage to get the system to work, the one bit
delay loop ontop of the 64b delay loop actually tells the system if data has or has not been written yet. This is crucial otherwise when we get a `0` we won't know if anything has happened or not. (Kinda ruined my first test a `0` did...)

The hardest registers to deal with where the middle two, by default these need to go and get more data. Which happens even before data is saved. There is a one tick delay before saving the data, allowing the system to send off the previous input back
and load the next input for the tick when we save the data. This method of immediate loading allows for us to not worry about later loading (which the original version had to do).

All the registers values are then sent to the ALU, which is currently just an adder and multiplier. This works just like how any ALU would work, decodes the opcode and then processes the values to store them in the input.

Testing it was easy, once i modified the file to have `12, 2` as the parameters of the first calculation.

### Part 2
(After making a backup...)

Just had to modify the file loading structure a bit,
![Additional file loader structure to clean the file and reset it](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d2/Screenshot_20250716_011453.png)

Part 2 involves finding a certain number from a given set of inputs, yes i could have done it manually but that would take at most `10201` different attempts, which i do not want to do... Hence i automated it. Due to how big the system is, and other
factors, i can only run the computer at a rate of aprox `8.3k tps` (`13k tps` if plugged in). Each cycle, takes about 456 ticks to execute, so about 16 numbers checked a second out of the 10201... so about 637 seconds. (although fells way less than
that). In the end, it takes over `900k` ticks to find my answer.

Something i had to make for this puzzle, is a 99 counter.
![My 99 counter, consisting of 7 wires looping around all over the place](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d2/Screenshot_20250716_011920.png)

It's a modified version of a previous 6bit counter i had made, just with 7 so we could reach 99. But unlike the 6bit counter, this contains extra logic.

For example, the stack of and gates at the top. This tells the system that 99 has been reached and to hence, reset to 0. Which has the additional affect of giving a 1 tick output as soon as the counter resets back to 0. This is useful, as it means we
can with something like a "+1 to count" input, increment another counter. (Oh look, theres the other 99 counter for the second place). Getting it to fire for exactly one tick was a challenge, as often the counter would go `0 -> 99` and send the next
counter to `99` without giving it a chance to do anything...

I have since slightly improved the solution for p2. One of the main issues (taking up 122 ticks **per loop**), was the fact of basically erasing the memory. (of which we knew). The computer needed to be reset, hence reset i did. Although only the
values that were intailly inputted, so anything outside of that range wasn't technically reset, but those values were probably not read anyway. The memory was cleared to 0 but the new solution just overwrote the memory. Doesn't really change that
much. And well, this new solution is better. Ending up with a score of `669k` ticks. A 34% (hopefully i got the maths right) improvement over the old version.

The only way to improve it even more, would be to improve the file loading logic, or remove it altogether. Something i did for the original intcode computer was just hardcode the inputs (after converting them to a form i could input). This works, but
i kinda prefer this new method as i don't have to worry about sharing private data, and besides, you just load and save to memory whenever you write a program for it right? SO, why not do it here as well?


## Day 3
First off, file looader. This is used in both parts so is important.
![The massive file loader, unlike other days](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_113034.png)

The core of the file loader is the same as previous, this structure
![The complex logic of parsing data from the file](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_113151.png)

The only difference to d2, is that:
- it's smaller.
- it contains a new component, this:
![The new component, contains a couple of and gates along with a not gate](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_113318.png)
Part of the input is `R89,U12,D34` with one of the 4 letters, `R U D L`. Hence we needed something special to convert them. I could have just used it like normal, but it's easier to convert. Kinda like doing something similar to
```rs
enum Direction {
    Up, Left, Down, Right
}

struct Movement {
    direction: Direction,
    position: u32
}
```
This component only uses a total of 6 bytes out of the input 8. Because its was very rare for 8 bytes to contain 2 inputs. Hence not worth trying to loop over to save space / ticks.

The other part of the input is outside, connected to the RAM (slightly cut off top right), the file decoded also has an option to detect new lines `\n`, which we can use to our advantage. The memory gets filled up with each node on the first line.
As well as the step jounrey for p2. We only save the first line as we can process the second line live as there is no more than 2 lines. Additionally, the positions are stored instead of the raw commands so that we have less processing to do later.

This took me a while to figure out, but there was one missing `switch` which kinda caused a whole lot of issues.
![The annoying switch with a bunch of wires](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_115412.png)
With the test data, the file size was small enough that the decoder always decoded to `0`, however the real test data was big enough so that the decoder decoded to `110` which kinda offset a line by a lot...

### Part 1
Which was really annoying... So much so i've had to ask AI for tid bits, and even went into [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) to draw out some of the lines so i could see what i was doing...

I made the computer once, all went well. Tried it on the tests, everything passed. Tried it on my real input and failed terrible. I'm not entirely sure, but i think part of the reason was using `i16` as my data type for the position so:
```
X (i16): 0000 0000
Y (i16): 0000 0000
```

Combined into a ?-32b (`?-` due to well, it's neither `i` or `u` as it contains both.). I did this thinking that `i16` was enough but well, it might not have been... So i upgraded everything to `i32`. 100% enough. Which also made me run into many
small bugs along the way as pretty much EVERY COMPONENT had to be upgraded.

One hardest bit was the logic for the interception points. This i couldn't be bothered to draw down and work out (after a few failed attempts), so i just asked AI for some rust code.
```rs
// Now, the function to find the intersection!
// We'll return an Option<Point> because sometimes there's no intersection.
pub fn find_perpendicular_line_segment_intersection(
    l1: LineSegment,
    l2: LineSegment,
) -> Option<Point> {
    // Determine the type of the first line segment
    let l1_is_vertical = l1.start.x == l1.end.x;
    let l1_is_horizontal = l1.start.y == l1.end.y;

    // Determine the type of the second line segment
    let l2_is_vertical = l2.start.x == l2.end.x;
    let l2_is_horizontal = l2.start.y == l2.end.y;

    // We are looking for one vertical and one horizontal line.

    let (vertical_line, horizontal_line) =
        if l1_is_vertical && l2_is_horizontal {
            // Case: l1 is vertical, l2 is horizontal
            (l1, l2)
        } else if l1_is_horizontal && l2_is_vertical {
            // Case: l1 is horizontal, l2 is vertical
            (l2, l1)
        } else {
            // If they are not one vertical and one horizontal, they won't intersect
            // in the way we're looking for (e.g., both vertical, both horizontal, or diagonal).
            return None;
        };

    // The potential intersection point
    let potential_x = vertical_line.start.x;
    let potential_y = horizontal_line.start.y;
    let intersection_point = Point {
        x: potential_x,
        y: potential_y,
    };

    // Now, check if this potential point lies on BOTH segments.

    // Check if the intersection point is on the vertical line segment
    let min_y_vertical = vertical_line.start.y.min(vertical_line.end.y);
    let max_y_vertical = vertical_line.start.y.max(vertical_line.end.y);
    let on_vertical_segment =
        potential_y >= min_y_vertical && potential_y <= max_y_vertical;

    // Check if the intersection point is on the horizontal line segment
    let min_x_horizontal = horizontal_line.start.x.min(horizontal_line.end.x);
    let max_x_horizontal = horizontal_line.start.x.max(horizontal_line.end.x);
    let on_horizontal_segment =
        potential_x >= min_x_horizontal && potential_x <= max_x_horizontal;

    // If it's on both, then it's the intersection!
    if on_vertical_segment && on_horizontal_segment {
        Some(intersection_point)
    } else {
        // Otherwise, they don't actually intersect within their segments
        None
    }
}
```
And this is what i used, in two components
![Component 1, converts input to vertical/horizonal lines and does basic initial checks](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_115729.png)
![Component 2, checks if the potential interception point is an interception point and returns it](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_115822.png)

The rust function is split into two, which is the two components. Even with the rust function, i ended up spending a lot of time just switching wires (switching `x < y` to `x > y`) because i thought the issue was here.

However, debugging is the hardest. To the point where we have debug sticks. To save wire space, combining the bits was common (like shown above). SO something like `Pos {x: 2, y: 4}` would be `29994738549230` instead.

![An example of the wire numbers being really complex](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_120236.png)

The top set of numbers is the actually positions, where as the bottom set is what the computer reads. I quite commonly had to copy and paste `[201863463010, 201863463036, 335007449195, 47244640363]` just to test something.

This is a debug stick:
![A debug stick](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_120931.png)

Give it any 32 bit number and it will display said 32 bit number. It's just simply dividing numbers by 10 and then displaying them, nothing special. It just helps the number be easier to read as it's not moving around a lot.

### Part 2
Really easy, after a bit of expanding. Memory went from `64b` to `128b`. More data was saved, more calculations were done. Part 2 was getting the minimum path to an intersection
![Part 2 addition maths](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_121415.png)

So, working out the current path length was done as the path was being steeped, Then we minused the length to the intersection. Doing a full length than minus just made things easier. Although did have to make an `inverseAbs32b` to make a number
always negative (instead of the classic, always positive)

The minimum circuit (also used in p1, but slightly different) is this:
![The minimum circuit, input on left, output on right and a bunch of logic in middle](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d3/Screenshot_20250723_121705.png)

The top part of the logic takes the first tick to load `-1` into the system. And yes, `-1 < 5` is true. But we're using `unsigned` here (as th e distance is never negative) so we can just use `-1` as a shortcut to `18_446_744_073_709_551_615`.
The middle contains a delay line, feeding into a Mux and then itself. This is basically the "memory" of the component. Then there is two checks, one for < the memory, and one for not 0. As `0` gets passed in a lot, we don't want to store 0 when its
not 0, and we need to only store if the new is less than the old.

The only downside is that it does take an extra tick to show the output, but it's only a tick so not the worst.

### Overally
The computer took 91k ticks to process all the ticks, slightly slower than the other computers in terms of TPS but quick enough to not take forever. (could be because of a lot of debug stuff left around or smth)


## Day 4
*Tiny Day*

### Part 1
An easy part to do. Didn't have to do many complicated things. Unlike previous days, i did have to once again remake the file loader. But the file for today is small enough to the point where it didn't need anything complicated.
![The loader for both part 1 and part 2, really tiny compared to other days](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_112347.png)
This loader (and the whole computer) is based off assumptions. But then the puzzle is given us all these assumptions. Hence we can do some tricks with the data to save ticks.

The first trick is the number inputs. As we can only deal with 8 bytes at a time, After the first tick, we send in a constant offset of `7`. This then makes the next 6 bytes be available to be read. Due to numbers only being 6 digits long (or 6 bytes)
Then a simple String to number converter is used in order to input them into the system.

![The main system, consisting of one big gate and 6 "cells"](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_112858.png)
Due to the constant input of `7`, we don't actually have to waste space storing the data from the file everytime. Does this mean we are technically reading the file multiple times? Yes, but i'm assuming the game has already read it once and got it
stored in memory so we don't have to worry about that.

The upper group of components, or cells get more complex. I had to make these twice just to get it working correctly. The purpose of these cells is to manipulate each digit of the 6 digit number we are given. I could have gone with manipulating the
whole number but then i would have to do a lot of `/10` or other more advanced stuff just to compare each individual digit. Consedering i'm already importing them as a digit each, it made no sense to combine them again.
![The basic dumb cell, containing a lot of logic components](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_113312.png)
The dumb cell is well, dumb. The center of the cell contains a 4 bit counter. Upon being told to increment, it increments and loops at 9 to 0. Due to the design of the cells, they affect each other, hence no need for a big number stored in 32b

- The white line is the increment line, it goes through a check to make sure we are incrementing when we get to 9 before outputting an increment signal. Otherwise we increment too much.
- The yellow line is the global overwrite line. This tells the system to use the numbers provided by the file loader instead. Hence how we skip the first X numbers.
- The teal line is designed for what happens when nothing is happening. The counter doesn't have an "store" mode. We have to give it it's own input in "overwrite" mode. But we also need overwrite mode for using other inputs.
- The gray line is output
- The cyan line is... useless. (Just tested and it seems that way)

Back to the main circuit, the big block at the bottom just checks to make sure that we are still within the upper limit of the range provided.
![RangeChecker, consisting of 12 inputs, and a bit of `>` and `=` logic](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_114413.png)
This took a while to nail down, because of having to compare each individual digit instead of the whole number. Just working out which order the `>` went in mainly was annoying.

And finally, the counter circuit.
![The last circuit, consisting of more less than, equal gates](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_114704.png)
This circuit has two purposes. To the right, a bunch of equal gates (4bit) are provided. These tell us if `Two adjacent digits are the same (like 22 in 122345).`. Or them all together and the output is the answer.

But wait!
> Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 111123 or 135679).

Which is where the less than gates come into play. Due to the counter not being too smart, some numbers will be invalid. Which this system catches. And lastly, the orange circuit counter which counts our total.

Overally, due to the `dumb` counters. This system takes ~474K ticks to compute the answer, which is too long. So, meet the new and improved smarter system
![](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_115426.png)
Which looks nearly exactly the same. We'll come back to that. For now, have a look inside the cell.

One of the tricks that can be applied is the ability to skip numbers. As digits can never be less than the previous digit, with the addition of the pink wire and a new input. If the current value is less than the value of the digit to the left of this
digit, we overwrite this digit value with the new digit value. This system saves us thousands of ticks looking at useless numbers. For example, if we have a 5-digit number starting with `7`. Numbers `70,000` to `77,776` are useless. Hence if we can
skip them, we can save looking at `7,777` numbers. And as the numbers are 6-digit, thats tens of thousands of numbers skipped.

The downside to my system is that it does take a tick to overwrite the number and output it. However, the smart system still manages to save 470k ticks... Which is like a saving of `99.35%`. I could try and fix that issue at the cost of more gates
but that would only save 100 ticks at best which the simulation can do in an instant. The downside to my system does however mean i need the purple wire on the main system. This delays the incrementing for a couple of ticks whilst the waterfall effect
was in play. I missed 3 key numbers in the one of the tests due to numbers it incrementing too early.

As it would increment whenever, given `200,000` by the time it got to `222,22x` `x` was already at 4 due to taking 4 ticks to fall through. Because `4 > 2`, we weren't going to override it either hence we just skipped 2 important numbers (`222,222` and
`222,223`)

### Part 2
After improving the cells to the quick version did i start on part 2. And thankfully i did, because having to check 300 numbers is way nicer than potenital thousands... However, part 2 still provided it's own challenges.
![The amount of "debug" and failed attempts for part 2.](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_121643.png)

Part 2 is simple. Out of the 5 wires provided by the equals checks. Make sure any of them are on, but two next to each other can't be on. Example, assume (top to bottom) wire set `2, 4, 5`. Is valid as 2 is on, but no wires around it are. set `4 5` is
not valid as they have a wire on the on of their sides, on. Due to my brain still trying to optimise everything as much as possible after p1. Many attempts had to be done. Most attempts would either exclude too much, or include too much. Eventually
(the next day after sleeping). The design furthest right was made. Which later got simplified into this:
![The simplest design to complete the day](Blog/Assets/aoc/2019/d4/Screenshot_20250819_122338.png)
This design goes off the principle that for line `x` to be active. line `x & x - 1` and `x & x + 1` must not be active. Writing this, i could probably simplify it even more, but it works so no need to go any deeper.

### Overally
A score of 2638/76 is achieved. Taking 3.1k ticks to run the whole computer. One of the smallest and quickest to run yet. I doubt anything else is going to be as quick or as small as todays is.
