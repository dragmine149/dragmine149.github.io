# This week has been a meh week.
I didn't want to leave this until today but whatever.

## A lot of things have happened
So a lot to talk about

## Lets get the elephant out of the room, i did a stream but well...
TLDR; My computer didn't like me.

That's the main point, with my current setup i can stream for about 10 to 15 minutes, up to 30 minutes if i'm lucky, but any more and i'm forced to take a break. To quickly explain my setup: Touchscreen Laptop running KDE Fedora 41.
To draw, i use the touch screen (and a touch pen). But in order to do so, i go into touch mode which basically involves having my screen flipped on the back of the computer. It's a really nice feature

However, a combination of that, compute power just means that after a set amount of time my laptop fan goes max blast. Or if it doesn't, my laptop gets too hot to the point where pretty much everything slows down to a halt. From inputs to window moving.
Of cause, it calms down after a while, although thats if i stop doing stuff. But i can't really afford to stop and start streaming every now and again. It's just a bit too annoying to deal with.

The other problem is, i can't really turn the 3d-ish images in my head to 2d images. Just trying to do the outline of a building where you are the otherside of the road is hard enough. The point of those streams was to try and work through that issue. But
if my computer can't handle it then well idk.

### So, now what?
I do want to do some creation of content. Which leads me to a couple of options really;
- Switch over into windows
- Reduce settings as much as possible so that there is decent quality and workability
- Wait a couple of years (maybe)

Switching over into windows is something i don't want to do, not for X minutes at a time and especially not when i'm required to do some more complicated stuff. If i'm playing a game like [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/), then yeah. But
something as simple as content creation is something i don't want to do on windows.

Setting reduction is possible, and something i'll have to play around with at some point. However i don't know if i can get a "sweet" spot. There is only so low i'll go before saying that "nah, this is unusable" even if it allows me to do stuff.

And the other option is to wait. And by that i mean, wait until a certain product potentionally comes out. My laptop is currently around 3 years old (as of time of writing). I would get a new laptop however...
There are two major conditions. Laptop needs to be [Framework](https://frame.work). And laptop needs to have a touchscreen display.
The touchscreen display is a major requirement, after playing [OSU!](https://osu.ppy.sh) for a year, and doing many other things with my touch screen, i've kinda gotten too used to it where it's at the point of something i kinda can't live without.
The touchscreen was originally a feature to help me do some work, which i don't need to do anymore. However the useful-ness of it has kinda made it a must have.
The [Framework](https://frame.work) requirement is more of a personal one. I just want to be able to repair my laptop easier if i need to. My current laptop has had the fans and battery replaced once, and just finding new parts. Replacing them wasn't as easy
It's possible and doable but i want something simpler in the future, hence framework.
So until framework comes out with a 16in touchscreen, fully rotating display design. I'm going to continue to use my current laptop.

As for the purpose of content creation, i'll figure something out. It might be a while before another stream happens though.

## Now that the "major" event of last week is out... I've finished another game.
Not alone this time, and something more complex than a visual novel.

No, this time along with a friend. We both completed [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/). It only took us `167 hours` (well closer to `160 hours` due to some time being purley AFK).
Trying to show off the whole world in one blog post is too much. So take this overview:
![A completed satisfactory world top down view of all power lines, factories. Imaged generated from https://satisfactory-calculator.com/](Blog/Assets/2025-03-16/satisfactory.png)

I say completed and well technically we did. 100% all achievements (which means, space elevator completed). This completion also includes Ficsmas (special christmas event in satisfactory). However, the nuclear factory doesn't make/use ficsonium and isn't
decorated unlike every other factory in the world.

I'll leave this up to the reader, but below is a list of factories/sub-factories. Try and connect them to the spot on the map.
- Ficsmas (Christmas)
- Coal power plant
- Nuclear power plant
- Encased uranium cells
- Steel ingots / Iron plates / Concrete sub nuclear factory
- Mini caterium factory
- Catermium factory (computer, high speed connector, etc)
- Oil factory
- Iron factory (plates, rods, rotors, screws, reinforced plates)
- Copper factory
- Concrete Factory (although really tiny)
- T9 factory
- Alumnium factory
- T9 oil sub factory
- Steel factory
- Heavy Modular Frame factory
- Main Base (not a factory but well)

I might conseder release the picture of the factory locations next week. But for now, satisfactory is completed, until 1.x comes out.

One thing i will say though, is underground hypertube cannon tunnels are SOOO useful. Even better than the T9 portals. We built a network of hyptertubes underground to the major factories. And yes, a lot of glitching through the ground was required.
But the benefit was, a clean and quick way to get anywhere. For example, taking the surface hypertube to the coal power plant took ~2 to 3 minutes, depending on entry speed and factors. However, taking the underground hypertube could get you there in ~30 seconds.

Once you've done it once, it ain't that bad to do it multiple times, other than some unseen invisible water hitboxes, and a massive void. To do the trick, make sure there is a powered entrance above ground, but close enough to the ground. Then use a train
to glitch into the ground (trains can go through terrain, and if you get out whilst in the terrain, you spawn in the terrain hence underground). Once underground, build and connect up the hypertube.
As soon as you have one connection, the rest is really easy. Just be careful of the invisible water hitboxes if you go to a certain level, those required different stratergies to deal with.

Add a hypertube cannon on each end of a long tube, and without taking up much space above ground (could be useful in small factories), you can go anyway super quickly. Although portals take less time to build, they also require a constant flow of items and can't
be setup until very late game. They also felt the same speed as some hypertubes consedering we had a fairly cernterailsed base. Hence why i stand be the hypertubes are better.

## Enough about satisfactory, the major website update (part of the reason for the delayed blog).
I wanted to wait until i released this feature before writing a post, hence a part of the delay.

This update is the improvement of the DateNight system. Using math, external modules and guess work. The background should hopefully be slightly more realistic.... When it doesn't break. (still got some things to iron out).
Along also comes 4 new settings, with a small setting ui update. Those settings are all part of the datetime category and consist of:
- Enabled
  > Enables the background to update depending on time of day. Disabling this allows for setting a static background
- Realistic
  > Uses maths to have the background as close as possible to the real day/night cycle. More useful in winter/summer when day and nights are longer. Disabling defaults to a 12h/12h cycle. (6am->6pm)
- Location
  > Uses the user location (not stored/shared in any way shape or form other than a temporary variable), to hopefully improve the results provided be realistic.
- Default
  > The state to use when the background is not allowed to update. Can even been set to a dark / light colour as well.

This update has also made the background use quarter-hour colours (which took a while to AI generate) instead of the old hour system, this allows for more flexability on the end and start times.

The annoying thing about this update, was working out how to get the location if the user hasn't given us their location. Because in order for us to calculate the sunrise/sunset on a particular day, we need a location...
The way this is done, is by a massive JSON list, found here: [timezones.json](https://github.com/dragmine149/dragmine149.github.io/blob/main/Scripts/DayNightCycle/timezones.json). This list took ages to generate with AI (kept timing out), and a lot of money
(only Â£2 of my free teir on zed though so maybe not a lot). That list, plus the result of [Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/resolvedOptions)
allows us for a accurate timezone, to location. (which also should work if you are in the northern hemisphere or the southern hemisphere).

If something doesn't work, just issue a bug report and i'll look into it. The maths for this system was not fun, especially something that few people will probable notice. However that what makes it fun to make.

### So, whats left of the month website todo list?
Taking the list from before and adding checkmarks

- [X] Settings (should be this weekend)
- [X] Improved day/night system (soon hopefully)
- [X] Figure out a way to "fetch" images from `raw.githubusercontent.com` instead of bundling them with the website.
- [ ] Blog improvements such as:
  - [ ] Back button (other than browser back)
  - [ ] Ability to link to certain parts in the blog
  - [ ] Ability to jump between blog headings
  - [ ] Improved CSS (links and lists don't really look all that well)
  - [ ] In-site links (links that show a page on this site will go to that page instead of reloading the site to go to that page).


So what left is just the blog improvements, which the goal is to be done be the end of this month. Hopefully those features aren't too hard to do.

## Alright main stuff out of the way, the other reasons for the delayed post.
The main reason is i went on a SLF binge and couldn't be bothered to write anything.

For those who don't know, SLF is short for [Shangri-La Frontier](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52347/Shangri-La_Frontier__Kusoge_Hunter_Kamige_ni_Idoman_to_su), which well (as per screenshot below) i've kinda binged watched to catch up with...
![MyAnimeList watch history for last week, contains a lot of entries but mainly full of Shangri-La Frontier S1+2](Blog/Assets/2025-03-16/Screenshot_20250316_212100.png)

I won't comment on it. Thats something i don't want to do and it's still ongoing. I want to finish it before giving my judgement.

## Alright, end of blog.
I've got some other stuff i need to finish today, so i better get on and do said stuff.

One last thing, as a teaser. Soon (depending on how much stuff i do on stuff) i might have a new mini project to share. Nothing of too much importance but still a project none the less.
