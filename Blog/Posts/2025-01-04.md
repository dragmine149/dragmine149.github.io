# A blog in the new year
Welcome to 2025.

## Where to start...
I talked a lot in my new [years eve/day blog](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2024-12-31) and not many interesting things have happened since.

So, lets start off with an idea i had of talking about

## Username, or well my name
This is a website meant for me, to show my portfolio of what i've done. Which most of the time a portfolio has the persons real name, yet i'm keeping my username here.
Because well, my username **is** my name.

Let me explain.

My username comes from a couple of years ago, i kinda forgot when, but at least 7+ years. Our family got an xbox for christmas, and each of us was allowed to setup our own accounts.
Previously my username wasn't one i liked but stuck with, and as we were making new accounts i thought it was the perfect time to change it, to my current username.

My current username is made up of three components. `Drag` `Mine` `149`. Each with it's own story.

`Drag` comes from one of my favourite games at the time [Dragon Mania Legends](https://dragonmanialegends.com/), well it mainly comes from the fact that i love dragons (still do, i even have a hoard of 7 who each come to be with me.)
`Mine` comes from `minecraft`, which was also a favourite game at the time (i still play minecraft from time to time, but only modded and kinda get bored after a while).
`149` comes from the fact that well... `Dragmine` was already taken and `Dragmine1` just didn't fit right with me, hence i needed to add some extra stuff. As it's been so long, i can't remember why those numbers exactly but well.

IMPORTANT NOTE: which i don't blame anyone for, but... `149` is actually pronounced `1` `4` `9` (`one` `four` `nine`) instead of `149` (`one hundred and forty nine`).

Because of how long my name is, i let anyone just use `drag` instead. Which has gotten me into some weird and funny situations sometimes (like this one, thanks blue...)

As i said, it's been a long time since i made that username, and due to my massive amount of time online (moderating a discord community, playing with friends over seas, etc). The name `drag` in particular has kind of stuck and is now like a second name to me.
In some cases (especially online), i kinda prefer people to use `drag` over my real name.

### Will i expose my real name
Well, i have no need to. I go by `drag` and prefer to go by `drag`. But as for my real name, well i won't expose it on purpose.

I'm not against hiding my real name, if you talk with me in a voice chat then i'll probably respond. Other than that, just call me by `drag` please.

## Alright, website business
Update, not much...
Although i have started on the next page, the `Projects` page. Which you can access but well...

After messing around with github actions and doing a lot of research, i finally have a system in place where you can preview any branch of the website. Just as a note of warning though, these branches might be unstable with things breaking all the time.
Eventually all branches will be merged into the `main` branch, hence visible without going to the sub branches. I just wanted this feature as a way for me to test things and as a way of me to publish things whilst still technically working on them.

For now, (i'll make a better system in the future), if you wish to access a certain branch, just go to: `https://dragmine149.github.io/Branches/<Branch Name>/<Location>`. (Replace `Branch Name` and `Location`). However do note, once the branch has been merged
into main, this path will no longer exist.

The better system i wish to make, is one where you can just go to `https://dragmine149.github.io/Branches` and go to a sub branch from there, but thats a future project to work out as most people aren't going to go to sub branches.

### 404 Page
Thats right, a page where there is no page. And my first time creating a 404 page.

A simple design of a 404 page, as well the main website design is meant to do the heavy lifting here.

Either way, this 404 page is designed to replace the default github pages one provided, (and for that one empty space where somehow you went to an incorrect page due to an oversight on my side).

### The hidden navigation
The navigation system is special, auto hiding itself to stay out of your way so you can enjoy the page content to it's fullest. However this also comes with the issue of: *How do i navigate between pages?*

As a fix for this, in the areas of the screen where there is meant to be a snackbar (for now, navigation and settings), there is a smaller fainter one that is on the edge of the screen, as like a hint.
The goal of this hint is so that the user will try to interact with it, due to it being something out of place, by doing so they will interact with the box that opens up the navigation menu and can change pages. This might not be the best option, but its an improvement.

My navigation system of auto hiding is unique, in a way but also proposes a hard challenge of how do we tell someone who has never visited this site before that they can navigate and aren't just stuck on an empty blank page.
At first (and is still in the commit history), i wanted to have buttons under the `Dragmine149` title on the main page, however those buttons just felt out of place. Maybe because at the time only one existed, even so moving them to the top hidden part is better.

Just because this system was meant to benefit the navigation system, doesn't mean it won't benefit other systems. For example the settings menu has also benefited as that is now shown clearer.

## Is there anything else to talk about?
Not really unfortunately.. Let me sum up my week since **tuesday** to you:
- watch anime
- play games
- improve this website
- work on [AOC 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)

## I mentioned talking about anime didn't i?
I did, however i want to do it in moderation.. I think if there is something i want to talk about then i will but i don't want to be forced to make an anime related section all the time.
Besides, anime is a place for me to escape to and has kinda saved me multiple times over the past year with shows like [Girls Band Cry](https://myanimelist.net/anime/55102/Girls_Band_Cry) and [Makeine](https://myanimelist.net/anime/57524/Make_Heroine_ga_Oosugiru)
Yet there are some shows like [Is the order a rabbit](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21273/Gochuumon_wa_Usagi_desu_ka) which i do want to talk about.

So don't expect anything out of this section, if you want to know my thoughts on an anime then just view said notes in MAL on my [completion list](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/dragmine?status=2) (i do keep track of everything i can in detail if possible).

### Talking about Is the order a rabbit...
Can i go live there?

It's the perfect mix between a medieval style city with enough modern day elements to keep suprising you at every turn (like that supermarket in town, like wat).
It's also a kinda of place which could make for a very good location in an open-world type game.

## Talking about open-world games
Does anyone know of any good open world games?

Wait, let me be more specific. MMO (massive multiplayer online) type games. And whilst we're here, gacha is out of the option.

For those who have watched [SAO (Sword Art Online)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online), i want to experience a place like that. Yet well i haven't found a place.

The problem is, i want each level, area of the game to still be relevant no matter if you are at the late game stage or early game (although maybe less relevant early game). Yet i also don't want to be in a position where i fell like i can't play the game due to
a level gap. As in, if i join the game a year or so later, i don't want to fell like **i have to play 24/7** to even be somewhat relevant with people who have already grinded a lot and have played the past year. I'm not saying i want to be able to beat a level 100
whilst i'm a level 0 but i don't want to fell like i need their help or are overshadowed by them even though i still want to be in the same server as those players. (It's a complex situation).
The game i'm looking for shouldn't also have data/season resets like i know some games do. Those are a pain unless you P2W (although aren't all the games with said features P2W anyway?). Unless the reason is valid (example, coming out of early access).

## Alright enough for now
I'm out of ideas, reached the 100 line count and kinda just want to go back to watching anime even though i still have some things to take care of.

I'll fix the spelling at some point... i do need to clear out my emails after all (every commit that causes my actions to be run does cause like 2 emails upon failure so my inbox is kinda big rn)
