# It is june. A special month
And to start with, we are speedrunning blog writing (like i always end up doing for some reason)

## I'm going to need to think of more interesting headings...
Because it's may recap time. So, to grab the may list....



and paste
## May goal list
- Finish off CC:Tweaked Boombox (and release it on github)
- Release EToH TT (not finish, just releasing it. If i attempt to finish it before release it's going to take a lot longer).
- Work on game some more
- Maybe work a bit on website.

## And... Nothing got "done".
Correction, things got done (see picture below of my commit history). Just nothing got released.

### CC:Tweaked Boombox.
This project is nearly completed, i've just been focusing on other projects hence why this isn't completed yet. The only things really missing is better playing, queue, and settings menu. Then its done pretty much. It's a project where i'll fix bugs only if they
get reported and i can be bothered to do so.

I'll try and assign a weekend to finish it in june hopefully, its just not the most fun to work on because of my computer lagging all the time. (even in a minecraft instance without that much stuff).

### EToH TT
Well, side tracked. Spent half the week trying to write a test suite (which i wrote and it works). Rewrote the UI (much better) and now working on a search feature. I haven't even gotten full feature parody with the "base" site yet. The features i'm still missing
as are followed:
- "Locked" Towers (towers and badges which can't be obtained due to not having the ability to get there)
- Difficulty lists. (Categories by difficulty instead of area).. Just had an idea for this might be interesting.
- Difficulty progress. (Probably add this to the lists)
- Area unlocks (porgress to unlocking next area, don't know what i'll do here yet).
- Tower filters (Probably going to implement this into the search feature)

Theres some code i want to rewrite (apparently a thing called `web components` is really useful). And some additional features i want to add (Favourte users, local statistics.) But that sort of thing is going to come, **after** i release it. Looking at the list,
it doesn't fell like there is a lot of stuff. But i'm pretty sure it's going to take me a while to complete either way. (If i try and guess a time, 90% probably going to be under-estimated).

I do have up til purgatory releases (personally goal). Even though The Starlight Archives are probably going to come out sooner, Purgatory seems more fitting as a last ditch release date.

### Website got something
*Did i already talk about this?* Oh yes i did, [last week](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2025-05-23).

### Game.
No progress. Too busy trying to finish other projects.

## So time for june.
The plans... Are going to do a complete 180. If my computer lets me.

### Attempt 2*, with knowledge.
Time to... ~~stream again~~ No, this time it's video creation time. Hopefully once a week every week of june.

I plan to:
- Recreate the WII menu
- Recreate the minecraft crafting table UI (from minecraft xbox one edition pre-bedrock)
- Make a v2 of deplantation?

All in godot.

It's going to be a mess, but just for the duration of june i'll try it out, then probably take july as a month off to recover. That being said, it all comes down to if my computer will let me record godot development without too much trouble.

#### A quick note about deplantation.
For those who don't know, it's a game i made for a game jam. I enjoyed making that game. You can go play the game here: https://dragmine149.itch.io/deplantation

The reason for the `?` is due to idk if i'll have enough time. But if i do, i kinda want to quickly upgrade that game and get a fun playable thing out whilst i'm still working on the main game that i've been hinting all these posts.

### Thats the main plan.
Due to how much effort thats probably going to take, i wouldn't be surprised if i don't get much of anything else done. But, it will get me away from web dev with a much needed break (it's been like 4 months of web dev, please help.)
Web dev hasn't been that bad, but i'm more used to constistantly changing between different codebases in different languages, hence looking at the same code is getting slightly booring, kinda need a short break to recharge.

I'll still try and find time to fit in EToH TT progress though because i just want to get it synced up to the main site ASAP.

## And now for end of blog.
Like always, i'll keep updating the blog, it's kinda a nice thing just to be able to type out a lot of stuff. A special blog is coming soon so look out for that. (It'll be released on a special day).

Somehow... Two games are getting updated this month as well, so thats going to be intrersting, playing those new updates as well as doing work.

Now, time to watch anime and do ironing. Then go to bed for a busy day tomorrow (start of WII project.)
