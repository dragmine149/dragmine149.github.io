# This should have been two blogs instead of one...
But we have it as one, so enjoy!

## First off, website updates!
After a while of no updates, we're finally getting some QOL updates, this time mostly focusing on the blog.

### You should have seen this already... but a BACK BUTTON
The blog has never had a back button, so for the longest time if you wanted to go back, you would have needed to click the "Blog" button on the navigation ui, or use the browser back feature. But now we have a big (maaybe too big) clear button in the top left of
the page. Waiting for you to click it..

This back button does nothing special, other than go back to the list. Because of the code that controls the site, it acts the same way as browser back or the blog button. No refresh or anything.

### I tried to add in a table of contents.
Got some of it working, but just kept running into issues with my code one after another. So for now i've decided to branch that off (after spending like 15 minutes messing around with `jj`) and will deal with that on a later date.

### Welcome to summer... actually nevermind back to spring.
I did have the website set to end spring on `20 April` however i've since changed that so it ends on `5 July` instead. Summer started too early. However this did get me thinking of what to do for summer background again.

I tried to replicate a water splash but the particle system i'm using is a tad bit limited in that way, so for now until i switch particle systems thers going to be... no particle background in summer.

### Other changes
- Temporary removale of stories (they are still technically accessible, just not via the top bar)
- Additional text on main page

## Why the updates?
At the end of may, i plan to release on of my sub projects i've been working on, the EToH TT. However upon release, the project will come under a sub section of this website. (`/EToH` to be specific). As such, i want to make the main part of my website in a decent
state, so that the traffic that does visit this part as well as the project won't be too disappointed.

I would like to do some other things before technically "releasing" the site, however i just don't have enough time for those and those things are only just mild improvements

## Now onto the more fun thing. Jujutsu / jj
[JJ](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) is a "new" (the git repo says its 5 years old, but it's new due to the fact that its gaining tracktion) VCS (Version Control System) just like git. However unlike git, it does a lot of things way better than git does and in the
most part, is much easier to understand than git.

I've switched over to Jujutsu for the EToH TT project and for my website just today in order to have a better experience with sorting out commits and changes. Going forward, i believe that all my projects will be done with jujutsu (when i get around to switching
over). The nice thing about Jujutsu is that it interfaces with git as a backend, hence allowing us to use it on everything without affecting anyone else too much as we can still push to something like github.

### A quick tutorial on the commands becauss why not.
```sh
jj git init # create a new jj repo with git
jj git init --colocate # Create a new jj repo from an existing git repo.

jj new # Creates a new commit
jj desc -m # describes the commit
jj log # view the log
jj log -r 'all()' # view all log (include those already pushed)
alias jjla="jj log -r 'all()'"  # Create an alias that is the same as above but with less typing.

jj new {parent} # Create a new commit off a parent commit (aka a new branch)
jj squash -f {commit} # squash changes from {commit} into @ (current commit)

jj bookmark create "{name}" -r {commit} # make a "branch" based off {commit}
jj bookmark set "{name}" -r {commit} # move the branch
jj git push -b "{name}" --allow-new # push a branch to git `allow-new` allows new branches instead of forcing existing.

jj edit {commit} # quickly go back to edit ANY commit (can also be used to stash stuff)
jj split # Interface to split a commit into two

jj # (default) view log

# less used
jj diff # view diff
jj st # view status
```
The above are commands which i used, so this is kinda a place for me to remind myself on what they are as well. But just using these is enough for me to be able to do pretty much anything i want to do with jj.

### The history is weird, kinda.
Not jj history, but git history upon using jj.

![Jujutsu history](Blog/Assets/2025-05-23/Screenshot_20250523_183526.png)
The Jujutsu history is normal, as shown in the image. You have the pushed commit before the branches, all the branches and then the current commit at the top.

![Git history](Blog/Assets/2025-05-23/Screenshot_20250523_183843.png)
However, when we look at the git history for the same repo... it's all over the place.

And yet, if you push a repo to github, due to something (and the `.jj` folder not included), and clone it, the git log is fine just like nothing happened. Amazing.

## Projects Progress
I'm working on two major projects currently, `EToH TT` and `Boombox`. Both of which i wish to release (not complete, release) before june. This week, `EToH TT` has gotten big progress, to the point where it's back in the same state it was in roughly a month ago.
The feature parody shouldn't take too long to complete, i do have to rewrite the whole display class again though which is not fun.

`Boombox` might not be completed in time, thats a lot of slow trial and error, made even harder by the fact that minecraft likes to lag, a lot no matter how much resources i give it. (or even how low the settings are). Although it's mostly there, it'll still
take some time.

## Lets talk AI.
Since Zed added [Edit-predictions](https://zed.dev/edit-prediction) back in february, i was kinda using them daily. Just recently (like last month), zed did an update to their pricing system and kinda removed the ability to do edit predictions due to a bug not
giving me access to the free teir. During this time, i've kinda been using AI slightly less than normal. So time to talk about it.

### Edit-precitions
Edit-predictions are nice, especially for repeated tasks (when it decides to repeat correctly), just being able to spam tab to mass do something is where they shine in particular. However sometimes they just get in the way and other times they are just not functional
at all. After spending time with and without them, i kinda prefer using zed without them and being able to code without an AI getting in the way changing my thought process whilst i'm actively typing something.

#### Changing thought process?
For example (this happened in the early days whilst there were still some bugs), there would be times when i would type a comment, or a blog and the edit predictions would fill something in for me. Then i would be forced to take that train of thought instead of
continuing with my train of thought originally. This got annoying hence i quickly disabled them in stuff i want full control over. Whenever i read to check that the AI did something decent, i kinda just forgot what i was going to write instead, hence struggling
to continue and finishing my original thought.

#### Repeativite code
Good code shouldn't repeat too often, but when you go to rename a variable (and don't actually know the keybind yet...) It's nice to quickly spam tab to go through them all, especially when it could also do multi line stuff. It's a bit annoying it could do so
much at a time before having to spend a tab to scroll the UI however it was really useful.

#### Would a different model make it better?
Probably not, the model Zed is using is already good enough, the only thing that could be better is probably another human, or a system where i could tell the model (using some kind of keybind or smth) to be limited to a speicifc section or file.

### AI Usage
Although, using LLMs in general. Its something i have once again used slightly less of due to being limited, although github does contain the free models (which i switched over to) i don't actually know my usage for github. Github tells me the limit but not my usage
As such, using it in the code editor has been more limited especially as it's hasn't been that helpful with what i've been doing these past couple of months.

As per [Theo's Video -> `React Is the Last Framework (for People Using LLMs)`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1FLEnKZTAE) (DeArrow title). AIs are trained on so much data of one kind that they can't easily adapt to over environments. My website is an example of this.
This website uses no frameworks, uses the Browset style JS where things are globals so don't need to be imported. Somethings the AI can do just as fine, but other things it wants to use a different way of doing so.

It also doesn't help the JS community doesn't fully support my way of doing stuff, i'll explain more later.

This doesn't mean i'll stop using AI, i'm still using it (and the free models on https://t3.chat) but i'll just use it less and only really in cases where i think something would just take longer to find out how to do if i just searched for it. (consedering search
is not useful sometimes)

### Agents
The next new big AI topic, Agents. Personally i haven't used them yet. The idea behind them is both cool and not fun. Agents are meant to keep prompting themselves generating more and more code to eventually give you a full completed project based on a couple of words. Which sounds cool, and could defenitally kick start a project. However it comes with some issues. (like everything)

- From the examples i've seen, the agent likes to leave their code in a broken state, hence i'll probably have to do some debugging before i could get to anything actually interesting.
- They sound expensive, i'm not willing to pay for that yet.
- Like the previous point, they would force me to use a specific way of writing code, which is MY choice how i write (although i do try and follow the language guidelines) it's still something i don't want.

### Overall...
I've using AI less. At the moment the only thing that would get me to use AI more is if it gets to the point where we have basically made an artificial brain. At that point, AI might be good enough to adapt to any way of working and not just want it knows.
I know i could just give in and change my way of coding to use something like a framework (in js) or the more common approach to which AI has a lot of data on, but by doing so i kinda lose some of the charm of just being able to do what i want to do.

## Now time for the stupid thing, i'm writing my own test suite.
As said in pretty much every previous section, JS doesn't have a big community around the way i'm working, you try to search for something online and everyone pretty much expects you to work in a framework, or a certain way. Hence finding things in general can be
hard. Testing is one such example.

I tried out different suites like `jest` and `nightwatch`, however they seemed to act like i had to use something just to get them to work. If i tried to do it a different way, i would get lots of errors which are not easily fixed without changing how i work.

As such, for now i'm writing my own browser based test suite. The automatic testing thats done in workflows will instead be done by launching a headless browser (and server), sending the results of the test to the server (via requests) and storing them for the
workflow to process.

However this does mean, writing a basic test suite because well... If i tried to find one, it would take forever. Normally a test suite is one in which i avoid remaking the wheel for. But in this case i have to make one. Making it's been interesting though,
writing the syntax (test) to test itself whilst writing the test suite itself. Kept (and still) running into issues of how to make it extensible whilst not too complex or too hard.

## And thats everything for this blog.
Pretty much wrote everything that was on my list of things to write about this time. It's been a while since i've had this much content to write about, it's nice. Now i think i'll go and try and complete the downloading section of the boombox UI at least.

There is one thing i haven't written done yet, but i'll leave that til the june monthly as it's related to june. So for now.

Enjoy your (long) weekend and week, until next time.
