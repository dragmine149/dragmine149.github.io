# Time to write a blog whilst i'm waiting for stuff.
Might as well do something, especially when i don't know how long its going to take.

## First off, lets get youtube out of the way.
Youtube is always annoying, there is nothing perfect about the platform. And nothing will be perfect, its hard to make things perfect for everyone. However we can still complain at annoying things like we all do.
Although when i complain about something, i'll try and praise it as well.

### So this issue? Is the homepage
For those who are signed into youtube and see the homepage, you'll know that there are rows of videos (and other stuff which we don't care about). The videos are important here.

This could be a issue specific to my setup, but recently youtube has updated it so that i only see **3** videos per row. Is it useful? For me, not in the slightest. For other people maybe. To explain this better, i've attached a screenshot of my screen.
![Youtube in the top left corner of my screen, full screen screenshot](Blog/Assets/2025-04-18/layout.png)

Hopefully the screenshot above will show you the issue i'm having. Due to my screen resolution (`3840x2400`), i have firefox setup at `130%` zoom insteaad of the default `100%`. Even then, upon zomming out to get more videos/row. I have to go to `80%` for 4
and it won't even let me display 5.

I would be fine with zooming out a bit, if not for the fact that it makes all the text pixalated (and a lot of blank space around the video when actually watching the video). So, the next step is to do what any developer would and reverse engerneer it.
(why would i go on social media to complain when i can just fix it myself?) Turns out, the fix is really simple. Youtube has a custom css variable just for this one thing. Thanks!

That variable is `--ytd-rich-grid-items-per-row`. It comes up in multiple places, so you'll have to find the lowest one to be able to change it. Which (due to devtools picker) is easily found, leaving this `div[id='primary'] div[id='contents']` query string.
Then, combining it together with one line of javascript produced: `document.querySelector("div[id='primary'] div[id='contents']").style.setProperty('--ytd-rich-grid-items-per-row', 5)`. (I've set it to 5 because 5 is perfect for me, however it could be anything)
![The better youtube with 5 videos per row instead of 3](Blog/Assets/2025-04-18/Screenshot_20250418_171636.png)

But there is one finally problem, i don't want to run that command everytime i load youtube. Especially when i just want to listen to the first audio video i see. So, time to use an extension. The extension i'm using is
[Enhacer for youtube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube), however any extension that can run js on yt will work. I'm using this one for other things, so might as well get it to run the js as well. With some additional javascript code (to allow yt to load
). I eventually made this chunk below
```js
// Sets the youtube style so that we can have 5 videos on a row
function load_ui() {
  console.log('e');
  document.querySelector("div[id='primary'] div[id='contents']").style.setProperty('--ytd-rich-grid-items-per-row', 5)
  console.log('e2');
}
const waitForContents = setInterval(() => {
  if (document.querySelector("div[id='primary'] div[id='contents']")) {
    clearInterval(waitForContents);
    load_ui();
  }
}, 100);
```
Every 100ms, we check to see if the element exists and if it does we set the style property as we worked out how to do earlier. This doesn't work 100% of the time, and it does have to wait until the videos are being shown (instead of the black boxes) however the
time when it does work just makes yt so much better. And in case it still breaks, you can just call `load_ui()` in the devtools of your browser. Performance isn't an issue, because it will only run on load and will stop the interval upon running. hence you don't
need to worry about some code running every 100ms (not like there isn't already a ton of code probably running even quicker *looking at you particle.js*)

**NOTE: This will not work on the subscriptions tab or the channels video tab or any other videos per row thing, they seem to use different css and haven't been modified yet so i'm not worried about them.**

### Alright, time for the nice thing.
It is always hard thinking of a good thing, but for every bad thing there must be a good thing so. To pick one would to pick the massive amounts of hours of videos of bgm/music that i've watched. Aka, a decent-ish algorithm for music.

Most of my time on youtube is spent listening to music (i have downloaded some but its not everything i listen to, so i still need to download more before i might listen offline). So having a good recommendation algorithm for audio is nice.

## Next topic... You can do a LOT with css
As part of my [EToH](https://github.com/dragmine149/EToH), i've had to create a [proxy](https://github.com/dragmine149/roblox-proxy) so that the browser can request data from roblox's servers. To help me out whilst developing ETOH and for future projects, i wrote
documentation for the proxy (which can be viewed here: https://roblox-proxy.dragmine149.workers.dev/). However, due to how i'm using cloudflare the usual way of button hidden content via javascript can't be done. Something like this for example
```html
...
<!-- Example, not actually anything -->
<button onclick="expand_content('div1');">Expand</button>
<div id="div1">
  Some content
  ...
</div>
<script>
function expand_content(id) {
  let elm = document.getElementById(id);
  elm.hidden = !elm.hidden;
}
</script>
...
```
Can't be done because i can't run custom js. Hence we have to do a different solution. Which asking AI and kinda looking around a bit, came up with this reasonable working (surprisingly) solution.
```html
<!-- example.html -->
...
<link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css">
<div>
  <input type="checkbox" id="toggle-{toggle_id}" class="toggle">
  <label for="toggle-{toggle_id}" class="toggle-button">
    <span class="expand">Expand</span>
    <span class="collapse">Collapse</span>
  </label>
  <div class="toggle-content">
    Some content
  </div>
</div>
...
```
```css
/* example.css */
/* Don't want them seeing the content */
.toggle-content,
/* Can only really show one thing */
.toggle-button .collapse,
/* It's expanded, no need to show it */
.toggle:checked+.toggle-button .expand,
/* The input is ugly */
.toggle {
  /* So hide them */
  display: none;
}

/* It's expanded, hence show the collapse version */
.toggle:checked+.toggle-button .collapse,
/* It's expanded, we can show data now */
.toggle:checked~.toggle-content {
  display: block;
}
```
And thats it, All that is left to do is to give it a name (replace `toggle_id`) and to stylise it even more. And there you go, a toggleable button. This system although it doesn't use javascript at all, does come with one major limitation...
> All content must be in the same or lower element as the parent.

Due to css not having any parent selectors, everything must be done in the same level or lower (can't go higher). For example...
```html
<div>
  <input>
  <label></label>
  <div>
    <div>
      <span>CONTENT</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>HELLO WORLD</div>
```
Anything in the inner `divs / span` can be modified. However, the `HELLO WORLD` content div can not be touched at all by the button. Other than that, the button can be stylished however you want. And it can affect multiple elements at the same time.
(Multiple elements are done by using something like `.toggle:checked~{element query selector}`).

The whole point of this section was to explain how to make something that is kinda surprising to me as something that can be done without javascript. I don't know if this is more efficient compared to js or not, but it works. I might even use it in some future
code areas instead of using the js menu. Even doing this has shown there is a lot of potential with css (might even be able to improve the hover system on this website)

## And thats all.
The two majors things this week i've talked about and i don't yet have enough progress on other stuff to be worth talking about it. EToH is slowly getting there (just need to do the UI side now) and the other stuff has kinda been put on hold.

So to wrap the blog up like always. Cya next week. This has been a very code heavy blog...
