# Release day!
Not one, two. But three release all at once, so enjoy this longer-ish post. maybe idk how long it's going to be yet...

## Lets start with the booring release.
[roblox-proxy](https://roblox-proxy.dragmine149.workers.dev/) (my proxy for the roblox api for EToH TT) got updated from v0.3.3 to 0.3.4 with some slight changes which i'm not going to into here, the update log does that.

Although this update was kinda just thrown together. I wanted to update the UI slightly without having to do a whole `0.3.4` for a small very tiny thing, (and `0.3.4.1` would just be a bit stretching it). Normally i would just do the `yyyy-mmdd` but this is the
js world where they do things differently so i try and follow the crowd the best i can.

The update also included a `/icon` endpoint, which i only found out during testing that well roblox requires authorisation. So it's semi working semi broken, i'll fix that at some point in `v0.3.5`. Can't be bothered to do it now.

## Which to do next... The tower tracker, leave the best for last.
Thats right, the project i've been working on the past... (Started work on <t:1742839080:D> so just over 2 months ago). And now it's released! The source code is all alvalible on github, and the project can be accessed via `/ETOH`. Do note though, it has a
totally different look to this website so be warned. (Also a lot of the systems there work differently than they do here).

The project itself should explain everything about it and more. Unlike most sub stuff in this website (projects, stories, blog). This time it's a whole different repo that can be found here: https://github.com/dragmine149/EToH. Added onto this website via
the power of `git submodules`

You can read more about the project here: https://dragmine149.github.io/Projects?project=/Other/etohtt or check out the project yourself here: https://dragmine149.github.io/ETOH. Load my user data here: https://dragmine149.github.io/ETOH?user=dragmine149

As much as it is release day, i don't really have anything else to say about it. All the interesting stuff i've explained in previous blog posts or the website explains itself. Well either way i just hope people can actually get some decent use out of it.
I'm still debating whether to add it to the nav bar or not. Although i think i'll decided that next time i come back to do work on stuff like that.

## And finally

## After a *please standby, checking github*

## Year of development... (wow, really?)

## I, dragmine149 deem

## This website... To be released

## (And yes, i made that dramatic on purpose)
Okay, correction. It's actually been just under 7 months, i just made this repo 4 months before i started development (a year did feel like a bit too long)
![The very first two commits, shown 4 months apart](Blog/Assets/2025-06-07/Screenshot_20250607_212614.png)

Anyway, even if it hasn't been a year i still deem this website to be released. Although it's not in the perfect condition i would like it to be (Especially settings, projects, stories and mobile support). It's in a state which can be released. And if i'm
releasing the EToH TT under my website, i can't really release part of a website.

So although i said release, treat it more of Early Access / Beta release in a way. Except there to be dragons everywhere. I will keep working on my site, it's kinda become something i've enjoyed doing a place to truly call mine, something which is also not
like any other website out there (to my knowledge at least). I'm now going to take a month or 2 away from web dev (hopefully, might have some critical bugs to fix...) and then come back to finish up features and make everything look better. This also goes
for the sub project of EToH TT.

I'll keep writing blogs, they have been useful for me personally just to speak about more things than i would do otherwise due to personal issues. (The void on the web is a weird place. I shouldn't in a way be this open but i don't care that much, just makes
things more interesting in a way.)

## Don't worry, i haven't forgotten the weekly dev logs i promised last week.
However they aren't going to be so weekly. The first video already took me like 1/2 hour just to edit 4 seconds worth. I haven't edited in a long while but at least i can kinda listen to my voice now (and i have decent software). I just need to learn how to use
things and how to make videos again. It also doesn't help that i'm having to follow another video to work out what i'm actually meant to be doing in the project.

I did also get side tracker with EToH TT and consedering how close i was to completion, i thought i might as well just grind that out, complete it and get it out of the way with.

## And now, for me to claim my so called "reward"
AKA, time to binge anime and not do any work for the next couple of days!

I'll probably play a lot in that time as well, but i do want to get through some of the anime on my second second list. (i have 200 anime on my ptw, so i have another list for priority, and a priority list for that yeah...)
So for now, just got to fix some few bugs with releasing stuff, send some messages and be done for the weekend (and monday maybe).
