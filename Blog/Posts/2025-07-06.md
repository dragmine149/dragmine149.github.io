# It's sunday! But it's saturday... Well heres the friday blog.
When sleep schedules are never aligned with the day it is...

## This week has been a long week.
So much so, i even slept in today (saturday) just so i wouldn't accidently sleep in on a day i can't really afford to sleep in.

## Lets start with typescript.
As i mentioned in my start of [month blog](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2025-07-01):
> Now, i have a list of a couple of things i would want to do with my website to make it even more better. For example:
> - Convert to typescript

Typescript, being a superset of javascript makes it easy to convert, and being typed is really useful (as like every other language i use is typed). The problem is... compiling typescript... for the web.

Let me explain, with another project

## A homepage, without food.
I have a raspberry pi 5, which acts as:
- git server
- torrent server
- media library server
- php/wordpress server

A lot of stuff, with web based uis. All at different routes/ports. Hence i wanted to make the default site (`192.168.120.15/index.html`) something that could link to all the other sites. SO, with a lot of help from AI (Gemini 2.5 flash) i made this UI:
![A UI showing 6 buttons, each with their own separate icon, title, description. Top left contains the text `Pi, without any food`. Top right is an theme option menu][Blog/Assets/2025-07-06/Screenshot_20250706_002623.png]

A Web based project... again. And here i was going to take a break from those... Hence why i did 90% of it with AI. (NOTE: This does not count as vibe coding, i was reading and modifying parts of the code), Took like 20 messages to get it completed

It's a small, one-day project just to spruce up a UI. nothing too complex. Yeah, the customise theme is a bit over the top but whatever. Due to not understanding the code (i didn't write 90% of it), i'm not going to share this one unless request, besides its
mostly common javascript features and some simple maths.


### How this relate to ts?
I originally wanted to try and do it with typescript, so i installed typescript:
```zsh
sudo nala install npm
npm install -g typescript
```
wrote some basic code, and a basic fetch request (with `await/async` instead of `.then().catch()`), complied it
```zsh
tsc
```
and ran it, to run into errors.

I tried searching online, changing my `tsconfig.json` per editor + online suggestions and could still never get a format to compile to js. I probably didn't search deeply enough, i was kinda tired and just wanted to get this out of the way as it was meant to be a
quick project.

## Hence forth.
I'm not going to make my website into typescript anymore. As much as i want to, and could probably try and find a tutorial for. It's just going to be a tad bit more effort than worth. Thankfully however, i have now enabled zed `inlay_hints` option which should
make working with js code way easier.
```jsonc
/// part of my ~/.config/zed/settings.json file
{
  // ...
  "inlay_hints": {
    "enabled": true,
    "show_type_hints": true,
    "show_parameter_hints": true,
    "show_other_hints": false,
    "show_background": false,
    "edit_debounce_ms": 700,
    "scroll_debounce_ms": 50,
    "toggle_on_modifiers_press": null
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Jellyfin?
Yes, jellyfin. As part of my rust torrent downloader project (and another reason left for those who can find it). I'm using jellyfin as a way to play media now. The setup was super simple, just shove it in a docker container (as the trixie branch had some issues
installing jellyfin), setup the config file, check all the settings, add to backup, install plugins, restart docker and done. Nothing too complex.

And now, i can just add videos to a folder on the disk station (NAS, due to a mount in `/etc/fstab`) and watch them in the **browser**. Due to plugins, the anime metadata is autofilled for me (most of the time), and i can watch on any device (as long as connected
home)

### Browser-fin?
The jellyfin media player app has one major problem, it does not currently integrate into the OS. Hence, interactions like `play/pause`, `next`, `previous`. don't actually work. Yet they do work in the browser. So, i've ended up with a round trip journey.

Browser (cruncyroll) -> Browser (free sites) -> App (torrents) -> Browser (torrents + jellyfin)

## qbittorrent has memory leaks.
I have all of `Yameii WITCH WATCH` currently seeding. (10 episodes) for the past 5 days. And somehow... The memory usage of qbittorrent creapt up from `50MB` to over `1GB`, even when it isn't uploading anything. It would make sense for memory to increase during
upload, but when it's not uploading things it's still way too high...

At least, this can be fixed/reduced by stopping all the torrents, and restarting them. yeah it's the not the best solution. But with the fact i'm going to automate torrent management via rust, and i'm limited to 8GB ram (tiny PI server) i can't really be giving
out free ram especially as jellyfin/gitea take up ~750MB together.

## I... reinevented the wheel.
A classic programmer situation, making something again that already exists. (NOTE: My youtube series i'm working on, even though i am recreating things i am porting them to another engine and doing them in my own way, hence slightly different),

Making a dropdown element in godot.

Does it already exist? Yes, in the form of an [option button](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_optionbutton.html).

Does it do what i want? No, hence the remake.

I tried to not remkae it, just modify option button to do what i want. But there are certain things where i just need a bit more control that i don't get unless i make all the elements myself. SO i made an even better version.

Also, why do option buttons have an `id` aspect? Just use the index, but i guess it can be useful for more data storage...

Anyway, i recreated it. Took a while, the hardest part was just trying to do the maths to get the subwindow to line up with the box when the main window was resized. The annoying part was working out why my input wasn't going through. Hence leading me to make
this tiny function
```gd
# Pass the text input through. Kinda wished there was a better way of doing this...
_window.window_input.connect(func(input: InputEvent) -> void:
	if input is InputEventKey:
		get_window().push_input(input)
);
```

I would show a video of it in action, but can't be bothered to create one and work out how to upload a video to my website. I can't really show screenshots as they don't explain it as well. At some point, i do want to release the dropdown code. Just got to work
out what i'm going to release with. The code is also a bit of a mess, missing a bunch of public functions (95% is currently internal "private") some watermark eastereggs. All which i'll add in as i end up using the code.

### Fun facts
- The dropdown is a mixture of the built in optionbutton, and the dropdown used in `osu!` setting menu. The osu! dropdown is already nicely done and contains extra features like builtin search which i recreated.
- The original dropdown was meant as a way to change FPS limit, which was also kinda taken from `osu!` (the options at least).
- The dropdown can not work pre 4.5beta1 due to features only included in 4.5beta1 (thanks `...args`)

Overall, making the dropdown was kinda fun. Nice easy side-project without much reputition.

## And once again, end of blog.
And like always, i end up somehow manging to write enough to fill up a blog even though i though that the amount of content i had to write about wasn't going to be able to fill up a whole entire blog.

I do wonder... How many words are on my blog... Please hold whilst i run `tokei`. Oh right, `tokei` can't count words... Well, instead i'll give these stats. Across my whole `/Blog/Posts` folder, i have:

Most of which, is literally just code snippets. Although 4895 lines of markdown is a lot...

## Oh right, end of blog...
I get distracted a lot of the time. it's kinda hard to work sometimes. Maybe i need to take care of myself a tad bit better.

Well, for now. I'm going to watch an anime and head to bed. And deal with rust program this next week (got to get it done soon as start of new anime season is here)
