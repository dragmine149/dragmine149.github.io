# There is enough stuff to make a blog out of this week.
Although, its a saturday blog for reasons explained later. Lets go in chronological order.

## Wordpress.
Normally, when i talk about wordpress its because of undocumented code, annoyances in the code / with php, or something similar. However last weekend <t:1746230400:d> was a different story. Due to some issues we were having with the website we were developing
for, i decided to contact support for help (via the chat thingy). Which went quite smoothly. It did take a moment to get through the AI Assistant, however the AI Assistant was quick to redirect me after it decided that it couldn't do much more. Talking with the
helper i got paired with was also nice. There were some times where it felt like, "Should i be doing something or just waiting?" but the otherall experience was a nice hour. I guess it felt better than what i was expecting because of all the stories i've heard
online, and all the scams exposing youtube videos.

The conversation we had is not one i'm going to post. But thanks to however helped me that day, even though they are probably not going to be reading this. I will also apologise if my javascript blocker caused 2 "empty" convesations as they weren't created
properly and caused issues.

## And now, lets collapse a whole entire week. EToH
I've been doing a lot of EToH stuff this week. From:
- re-formatting JSON (and rewriting the schema)
- Beating more towers.

### Lets start with the JSON stuff.
My tower tracker works all locally, in the browser. This allows for faster loading speeds and is just a more confitable way of working (personally). The "server" is a combination of github and cloudflare. (github hosts the files and cloudflare hosts the proxy).
In order to load information about every single tower and the badges, i've created a gigantic (well, 2 gigantic) JSON files. The format i went for to begin with, consisted of using it as like "categories", which does work but with EToH having joint tower points
my friend (Guy) thought of a better way to do it, which meant last wednesday <t:1746576000:d>, i spent all afternoon (like 3 hours), updating the schema and then reformatting the code manually. Could i have made a quick program to do it? Probably.
Creating a program might have been quicker but at the start i thought it would only take about an hour instead of three.

### Codebase stuff.
Along with this JSON rewrite, it also meant that both the rust code and js code have to be updated to account for the new format. Updating rust wasn't that bad, some things got in the way and i even switched to removing the binary from the repo. (Getting github
to do a build ever run now). Part of the reason for including the binary, was because i was slightly lazy and did `./data/...` instead of `../data/...` forcing me to run the program in the `..` dir. I also didn't want to get github to waste a bunch of build time
as the rust file (once perfected) is never really going to change. Hence it doesn't actually need to be rebuilt all that often. Fixing the rust isn't that bad, just a bunch of structs storing the data and some mini loops. I do however like this iterator i made.
```rs
let badge_list = used_tower_badges
    .areas
    .iter()
    .flat_map(|(_, area)| {
        area.iter()
            .flat_map(|info| info.towers.iter().flat_map(|tower| tower.badges.to_vec()))
    })
    .chain(
        used_badges
            .data
            .iter()
            .flat_map(|other| other.badges.to_vec()),
    )
    .collect::<Vec<u64>>();
```
Create a list of badges out of two badges lists (one for each of the json files on the server). The only thing i don't like is the fact that i have to `.collect::<Vec<u64>>()`. Personally i would have preferred to keep it as an `Iterator` type. However without
being able to clone the iterator and/or find a way to do `iter.next()` without actually doing `.next()` would have been harder. The reason for the iter is because later on in the code, we check to see if any of the badges we downloaded from roblox are in
our list or not, hence we kinda need to do a iterator in an iterator.

Updating the javascript wasn't that bad either, as i was already in the progress of rewriting some of the code, it wasn't that bad. Although this rewrite came with a lot of extensibility. My previous javascript could would require a lot of hardcoded variables.
However with this iteration, its so extensible i could just take it out of this project. The code is at the point where i could just do:
```js
class Tower extends Badge {
  /**
  * Makes a new tower badge.
  * @param {String} name FULL NAME of the tower.
  * @param {number[]} ids List of tower badge ids.
  * @param {number} difficulty The difficulty of the tower
  * @param {String} area The area where the tower is located
  */
  constructor(name, ids, difficulty, area) {
    super(name, ids);
    this.__addProperty('difficulty', difficulty);
    this.__addProperty('area', area);
  }
}

badgeManager.addFilter('difficulty', b => Math.floor(b.difficulty));
badgeManager.addFilter('area', b => b.area);
```
And be done with stuff already. I have code to load in the `tower_data.json` file, which is less interesting. This code is however as its one of the first times i've used `extends` in javascript. My game uses `extends` all the time, for default elements and
custom elements. Rust i haven't used enough to know yet. Being able to do `extends` though is actually nice as it hides half the code. Might have to update some files on my website now.

The goal above, upon running
```js
badgeManager.difficulty(4)
```
Will return me a list of ~~Badges~~ Towers with the difficulty (floored) of 4. The code behind the scenes is kind of nice.
```js
/**
* Makes a new map to have a shortcut way of getting tower data. Data can now be retrieved using `class['filter']('test')`
* @param {String} filter The thing to store in order to filter badges
* @param {(b: Badge) => any} callback What gets stored in the map for quick access to the badges
*/
addFilter(filter, callback) {
  this.__filters.push({
    filter, callback: callback
  })
  this[`__${filter}`] = new Map();
  this[filter] = this.__mapGetter.bind(null, this, this[`__${filter}`]);

  if (this.__badges.length > 0) {
    this.__badges.forEach((badge, index) => {
      let key = callback(badge);
      if (key == undefined || key == null) return;

      this[`__${filter}`].set(key, index);
    })
  }
}
```
I've used the ability to set things to `this` as a way of creating custom `getter` methods in a way. `.bind` took a moment to figure out (because of the first argument), The other thing is to do with actually filtering. The badgemanager works with anything of type
`Badge` (works with `Tower` as it extends `Badge` hence still technically a badge.) The filter makes sure that the data is valid, by filtering out badges that return `undefined` or `null`. As the filter supports anything, those that extend `Badge` can cause some
issues. The filter `b => Math.floor(b.difficulty)` seems like it should break on badges which aren't towers. However due to some quirk of javascript it doesn't. It just returns either `null` or `undefined` and continues like normal. Either way not having to worry
about those `x doesn't exist on y` issues is nice in its own way.

### And now, the big news.
I was semi planning on writing this blog, yesterday. However i spent 6 hours on [`CoPE`](https://jtoh.fandom.com/wiki/Citadel_of_Pyramid_Escapades). Two of which on the first act, three of which loop falling on f24 (pain), and the rest on the rest. However in the
end, i beat it. earing me this screenshot.
![Screenshot of beeting a tower. Top left contains the chat with the win messages. Top middle contains the beating first remolesses message and completing a monthly challenge. Bottom right shows two badges being awarded](Blog/Assets/2025-05-10/Screenshot_20250510_031322.png)

CoPE is my first remorsesless tower after only completing **2** intense towers (yes only 2, don't worry i'm not that insane). I took a go at it after talking with my friend Guy about it last night, and how it had quite a decent amount of safety nets (which it
had a lot of). The monthly challenge completion (of which it was a `Psychologcally unsafe` challenge) was just an added bonus. The tower was also my `111th` completion, which made it special. Like `CoHAD` being my `100th` completion.

Last night plan was just:
- Play around with jujitsu
- Do some more work on EToH TT
- Maybe play minecraft
- Watch anime
And yet i ended up spending all that time on a tower following a youtube video. (Thanks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yblhZghNTDM for the guide through most of the tower.)

## The end of the blog.
I don't have much else to say. I did try working on my boombox project, but my game kept crashing so i don't have much to say on that.

I don't know what i'll do yet today, or this week. But for now, cya in a week or two.
