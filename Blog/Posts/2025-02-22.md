# Another saturday blog
I kinda didn't know what to write about last night to make a full blog. But i remembered

## AI
Over the past month, i've been using [Zed AI](https://zed.dev/blog/zed-ai) and much recently [Zed edit-predictions](https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction) as well. SO today, near the end of the month, lets talk about experiences.

### Starting with the past.
Back when OpenAI made AI very popular with ChatGPT3, i tried it out because, well everyone was trying it out. I tried it out to the point of trying to make a python program with it. (Said python program can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/dragmine149/AI))

As per the repo, it took quite a while for the AI to do what i wanted, hence back then i decided that it wasn't worth the effort of trying to use AI to code. It also ruins the fun of coding by just getting the ai to do everything... (explained later)

### Right, back to the present.
2 years later, with a proper code editor and a much better setup.

I've been using zed ever since zed [released for linux](https://zed.dev/blog/zed-on-linux), version `v0.144.0`. I've had my eyes on zed from before that date, i was just waiting for the linux release.
Back then however, zed did not come with any AI. It wasn't until version `v0.150.0` that the AI got introduced, hence why at first i didn't use it.
And now, zed is on version `v0.174.x`, where i decided to use AI to some extent.

### What made the change?
I just wanted to test it out again. Before february, every now and again i was doing `CTRL + ENTER` and just giving the AI a task or two. Just to see what it does. Sometimes it was useful sometimes it wasn't.
Overall, i decided to stay away from it for the majority. But then february rolled around, where i started to work on 2 website related projects.

### I work with many programming languages
I'm a solo-dev. Most of the stuff i do, i switch between different things depending on the situation. So no language in particular is a strong suit of mine, which goes especially true for Javascript and PHP (correction, wordpress + PHP).

Doing stuff in Godot is easy, the language is like python (which i spent up of 5 years using, and still do time to time). If i want something, i can find it most of the time because i don't need aanything too complex.

However, when it comes to website based work with javascript, then stuff gets complex.

Javascript is complex, because it's built on a lot of backwards-compatibility requirements. There are somethings which the JS is missing or does in weird ways. Which makes AI actually nice to work with.
I spent the whole of last week (wb 10th February 2025) rewriting the page loader system for this site. (Which i talked about in [last weeks blog](https://dragmine149.github.io/Blog?blog=2025-02-15)). Partially with the help of AI.

The times i used AI was mainly for:
- mass-documentation (especially on smaller functions)
- collapsing big code blocks into one-liners
- Helping with stuff like debugging, and making sure things weren't going to cause errors by using `?` all over the place.

However, most of these use cases were done by the edit-predictions AI instead.

But, the AI was defenitally using in the world of wordpress.

Wordpress, has a lot of functions, and some terrible documentation in some places. PHP has better documentation, but just some weird features unlike any other language.

```php
// Like, why is this a thing?
// This is required so that the function `get_query_var("query_var")` can return the query. (the data in the `?` part of the URL)
add_filter("query_vars", function ($query_vars) {
  // custom query values
  $query_vars[] = "towers";
  $query_vars[] = "edit";
  $query_vars[] = "email";
  $query_vars[] = "editdata";
  $query_vars[] = "search";
  $query_vars[] = "searchName";
  $query_vars[] = "all";
  // $query_vars[] = 'test';
  return $query_vars;
});
```

So AI is useful in just getting the correct functions without me having a ton of knowledge of the language.

### AI is better inline than full programs.
Getting AI to do a small portion of code, whether that's using edit-predictions or getting it to generate the code for you. Small portions are perfect and work most of the time.
In all cases though, the code does need to be checked as i've had many times where it does something slightly different than what i want. But leaving it up to AI has taught me some different ways i could be doing stuff.

Getting AI to generate a full program seems to be what more of the recent hype around AI is about. And here, (at least out of the AI i've used so far) it's just not as good.

For example, [verbose.js](Scripts/verbose.js). Is a file entirely made with AI. Thankfully, unlike my AI project [2 years ago](https://github.com/dragmine149/AI) this is a smaller file and much simpler. Still took a while to generate though, with stuff not being how
i would want said stuff to be. (i do not have much logs or memory of said file, otherwise i would document it.)

### But there are still places where AI doesn't fit in.
Like these blog posts. It might be hard to believe, or it might not. But i use 0% AI when writing these posts. (Unless you count a language server that helps with spelling an AI).
When i do use AI, it's either for the purpose of writing something complex which fits in (aka doing research to get the word), or upon being specified like this part below:

#### Prompt: Introduce yourself to the viewers of the website.
Hello there! I'm Claude, an AI assistant from Anthropic. The author of this blog asked me to introduce myself to demonstrate AI-generated content. While I assist with various tasks behind the scenes, I want to emphasize that the thoughts, writing and authentic voice you see in these blog posts come directly from the human author, not from me or other AI. I aim to be direct and honest about what I am - an AI tool that can help with specific tasks while leaving the creative expression to humans.

But enough about me - the blog posts and content you read here represent the author's genuine experiences, perspectives and writing style. I'm just making a brief appearance to help illustrate some points about AI usage!

### Back to me.
That above part was doing using `inline`. Which makes it fit in a bit more than just going to a chat bot. But as shown and as what you've probably experienced with other AI demostrations, AI isn't really the best and it can be really obvious in cases when it is AI generated.

But what about `edit-predictions`? Those are just way too invasive. Initially, they are enabled for all files but i've since disabled them for blog post files.
I don't mind edit-predictions, it's a good way of quickly doing repeativity code, however for writing a blog post, they just get in the way. If i'm typing thing A, they might appear with thing B which i then check and forget about thing A eventually leading the
whole post to end up being predicted which i don't really like.

#### On another note, can i get annoyed at AI for spelling?
I come from england (GB), and as such, i've set my typos language server to use the `en-gb` version instead of the america (`en-us`) version. During that AI generated section, it used the wrong spelling.
I'll leave the spelling in, because it's AI generated and i don't want to touch that section without prompting it. But it is interesting that AI will default towards the american english spelling, then again. Most of the world uses american english by default so...

### Before i go to the future
So far, i've only been talking about the AI built into ZED. Well, i also have 2 models downloaded to run locally as well.

These models are [deepseek-r1:1.5B](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1:1.5b) and [mistral:latest (7B)](https://ollama.com/library/mistral:latest). As i'm running on a laptop, i have limited power to give them.
In the past, i've mainly used these for funny one of things rather than trying to make them do code related stuff, partial because of how limited these models are. But i thought it's important to still include them none the less.

### To the future of using AI.
I will use ai in more cases but not all.

Stuff like the blog post, my story, my dreams (coming soon), where it's mainly my thoughts into my void, i don't want AI invading and messing up my thought process.

Sutff like my game, or anything game related really, i would kinda want to leave up to myself. Yes AI might be able to assist, but it can't really assist in a lot of trial and error which is what happens with developing games most of the time.
You try something, find a bug fix it, find more bugs and carry on. It just fells too hard to get AI to help currently (it's too much data to feed AI if you feed it a whole gameplay feed), you kinda need a whole other person at that point which well, just hire someone.
In these cases, i would only really resort to AI if i'm stuck on something that i can't even find in the forums of whatever software i'm using.

However, for other stuff like website work, i will happily use AI.
Other than the edit-predictions sometimes over prediction, it's a useful feature to have especially when working with a bunch more possible functions that you have no idea what half of them does. Which is especially true to wordpress undocumented library. (and lake of possible lsps)

## So overall, my fellings towards AI.
The use case depends, but it defenitally seems useful in the correct cases.

If you get it to do everything you have to debug it and fix what it cannot, and once you fixed it, you don't get that boost of whatever it is thats like. "YES! Biggest bug fixed!" You also don't understand the codebase that was just written as well as you could do either.

However, if you get AI to do some small sections, it's really useful. Rewriting code, documenting functions, improving code with better ways of doing stuff. All small tasks that add up over time, but can be done whilst you still kinda learning something.
The small sections means that you still have to do most of the work, meaning you still get the satisfaction of fixing that bug which has haunted you forever, but stuff like explaining what the function and all it parameters does is a bit annoying to do time and time again.
Upon rewriting stuff, you either get smaller code or you learn something new.

SO overall AI is mid. I don't hate it nor do i love it.
I do not want a world where everything is AI generated, the creativity will be gone by then and it'll be the thousandth reskinged verosion of X or Y again. But i will accept AI generated content to some extent. I don't care if one day AI will get to the point where
it's soo good that it could do everything that it doesn't do currently. I still want to be in control of what i do and what code i make. If i would rather have a sense of community with hiring people and brain storming ideas together rather than one AI doing everything.

## I did not think i could talk this much about AI...
It's a whole blog post length, to which is kinda all messed up so good luck reading, oh wait... you already read it.

UNLESS

you skipped to the end didn't you?

Either way, you're reading this section now, so see you next friday hopefully. I'll have some announcements to make (the release of the story), talking about said story i should get back to writing said story. It's just gotten to the interesting part and thats going
to take a while to write.
