# What to title this post?
Either way, i'm going to get a lot of emails probably from this one...

## Where to start, ah the website.
Since the last blog, there has been a total of 34 commits. Aka 34 small improvements. Not a lot, but something to update about at least.

### New settings menu
The snow is (from what i know at least), a unique feature to this website. As in one that is displayed permanently no matter which page you go on.
For those who don't like that, a setting toggle is now available. By hovering in the top right corner this menu will appear, I plan to add more settings and toggles eventually, maybe even expand it into a big menu if need be.

For now, enjoy having no snow if you so desire to.

NOTE: Settings (as of writing this) DO NOT SAVE. Saving settings is a planned feature although that requires some documentation reading which i don't really want to do currently (and got to fix some other issues on the site first).

### Improved Hover System
The hover system has been slightly improved to better detect the mouse and allow for more control on when elements are shown or not. <br>
The hover system also now no longer makes you fight for that one small pixel to keep the menu visible whilst still getting a sub menu.

The hover system works by using the percent of the window that your mouse is in to determine if it should show or hide certain elements. Although there is support for all the sides + corners, i don't plan on making the website messy with that.
(otherwise i wouldn't have added in that system to begin with)

### New secret feature
Well, i say its secret yet the commit history and files absolutely give it away. Enjoy (i made it spam proof so yeah have fun). <br>
Oh right, javascript is required for the secret to work.

### Main Page Changes
The main page has had some small changes. <br>
The big one you wont see if you're seeing this. But it's basically a no-js warning. Basically if for some reason you don't have javascript enabled the website will warn you and suggest some ways of enabling javascript.
Although if you are reading this you have javascript enabled as this required javascript to even render in the first place.

The other small change is the removal of the blog button. The original plan was to have links under the title but those just felt out of place.

### Blog updates
Some styles have been updated to make the blog more readable. This time, the mini code blocks like: `this block` and `this block` are more readable.

### Spelling
This is a big one, but all the spelling (or at least most) has been updated and corrected. I added a workflow (although it activates in a bad-ish kinda way) to tell me whenever there is a spelling error.
It also tells me all the spelling errors so i can fix them.

Although most of the time spelling isn't an issue, it is kinda nice to have a completed site.

## Ok, onto something else now
This was just meant to be a transition segment...

## Advent of code takes a long time sometimes
Todays (13th) and Yesterdays (12th) took a really long time to complete. They aren't anything really complicated but the fact of implementing them in such a way so that they work is what mainly caused the long time to complete.
I originally wanted to write this post yesterday but due to how long yesterdays took i didn't really have any time left to write this. (I still haven't completed yesterday p2 as of writing this...)

On the other hand, this website has some mini aoc updates. AKA, the aoc blog has been uploaded. Now accessible at this location: [https://dragmine149.github.io/?blog=aoc%2F2024&load=blog.html](https://dragmine149.github.io/?blog=aoc%2F2024&load=blog.html).
Or via the new tab in the navbar. It's not in the best place, but for now it's in a place where it fits and can be easily accessible without going to a long link. It also means you can see part of my thoughts and complaints for every day this year.

## VKET
As a brief summary: A virtual place where (mostly) japanese based companies show off their products. Hosted in VRChat every summer and winter. <br>
<sub><sup>If you want to learn more about vket then visit the website: [https://event.vket.com/en](https://event.vket.com/en)</sup></sub>
But why am i talking about vket? Part of me doesn't want to, but part of me does...
Basically, a small streamer i watch normally goes around vket every time vket is active, on stream that is. This time they had an offline version of the tour which i joined in. <br>
<sub><sup>I'm leaving the streamers name blank not because they want me to anything, just because i don't want to share it.</sup></sub>

Long story short, out of the three hours, 2 worlds we played/explored. It was fun, It was even more fun because we were both in vr. <br>
Exploring vket was kinda like how i imagined going shopping in town would be like, looking around different booths trying stuff out and then maybe buying stuff. (Although what i imagine shopping in town to be is kinda based off anime + manga...)

We didn't take many pictures, but this one i have is particularly cute...

That VRChat Vket experience did teach me something, Just hug dragon and go for anything. Scared or not you'll most likely get through it fine.

I do have to thank the streamer for this opportunity, Due to not having many friends VRChat and VR is something i don't touch often. Being able to touch it again is nice even if i do end up playing at 30fps

## Apparently writing a blog post can be hard when your week isn't really all that interesting...
I suppose most of the time this week was spent on solving advent of code puzzles, so other than that nothing really happened. <br>
Welp, time for the fun part of fixing all of my spelling mistakes.
