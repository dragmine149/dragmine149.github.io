# Hi
These are the files for my website in all their glory. Fell free to look around, you might find some stuff that isn't normally visible on the website (although i doubt you will)

Although i would love you to check out the website instead: [https://dragmine149.github.io](https://dragmine149.github.io) for a more interactive tour.
I made this readme just to make it a normal git repo, thats all.

Hint: If you want to check out a specific branch, go to `https://dragmine149.github.io/Branches/<Branch Name>` (replace `<Branch Name>` with the name of the branch).
