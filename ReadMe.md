# Hi
These are the files for my website in all their glory. Fell free to look around, you might find some stuff that isn't normally visible on the website (although i doubt you will)

Although i would love you to check out the website instead: [https://dragmine149.github.io](https://dragmine149.github.io) for a more interactive tour.
I made this readme just to make it a normal git repo, thats all.

Hint: If you want to check out a specific branch, go to `https://dragmine149.github.io/Branches/<Branch Name>` (replace `<Branch Name>` with the name of the branch).

## Todo list
- [x] (once again) Improved page loader system.
- [x] Improved blog system (i want to use the `markdown` stuff elsewhere in the website)
- [ ] Finished project page
- [ ] Improved URL (hopefully via the use of `/.htaccess`)
- [ ] More blog features:
  - [ ] Code block detection (`) with keyboard controls -> replace with more better looking things.
  - [ ] Back button
  - [ ] Ability to link to certain parts in the blog
  - [ ] Ability to jump between blog headings
  - [x] Better blog formatting (images scroll instead of who blog scroll)
  - [ ] progress tracker (local storage)
  - [ ] search
  - [ ] category sorting
  - [ ] More time formats
  - [X] Separate marked_*.js files to their own repo.
  - [ ] Improved CSS (links and lists don't really look all that well)
  - [ ] In-site links (links that show a page on this site will go to that page instead of reloading the site to go to that page).
  - [X] Fix spelling
    - [X] and maybe getting a better spelling system?
- [*] Finished branch system
- [**] More seasonal backgrounds
- [***] Improved and more realistic day night system.
- [X] Figure out a way to "fetch" images from `raw.githubusercontent.com` instead of bundling them with the website.
- [ ] Mobile site / touch support.
- [ ] Improve typewritter API
- [X] Update beercss to 3.9.3   [https://github.com/beercss/beercss/releases/tag/v3.9.3](https://github.com/beercss/beercss/releases/tag/v3.9.3)
- [ ] Make a new object just for setting object states
- [ ] Test to see what happens with slower internet speeds.

### Notes:
- `*` -> It's in a state now where you can technically go to the branch (`/Branch/{BRANCH_NAME}`), however the end result is broken in more ways than one.
- `**` -> Winter, Spring have seasonal backgrounds. Summer, Autumn currently do not.
- `***` -> It's nearly there. Most of it is out on main branch, however a tiny bit needs to be finished off for it to be completed.
- `R` -> In research
- `?` -> Work has been done on it, but the completion is unknown
